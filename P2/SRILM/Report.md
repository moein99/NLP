models are almost the same.
for example:
"our keys" prob in my bigram = 0.0005167068549776093
"our keys" prob in SRLIM bigram = 10 ^ (-3.286756) = 0.0005167065893943473

same results can be concluded from log perplexities in this section.

couldn't find any logical difference between random generated sentences. :)
