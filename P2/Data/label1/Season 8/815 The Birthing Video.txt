Hey, so, uh, hows it going living over at Ross?
Bye.
Theres one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
Thanks. But maybe later.
You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentines Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that thats never going to happen!
Oh, okay.
No, Im not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between Joeys legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it, but really doesnt, and the dog goes running off.) Well, youre cute, but youre not too smart!
(looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?
Hi.
Oh, thats, uh, thats Phoebes friends dog. I dont know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
(to the dog) Cmere. Hey. Cmere. Thats Rachel. Shes the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with youwe love her. But we cant have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? Youre a guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be.
So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isnt going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
Hey.
No.
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!
Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
Rachel stuff.
Hes breathing!
No, no, no, no! Hes fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball) Heres your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
Hey, whats up?
Oh, man, Im sorry. Why?
Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentines Day.
Sort of.
You dont have to seem so happy about it.
Oh, II d
Forget about it. Its no big deal.
Its nothing.
Okay, uhsit down. (they do) Um theres this woman that I like. A lot. But, uhit cant happen.
No!
Yes.
Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesnt matter, because I cant do anything about it.
Well, its complicated. Shes with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because were really good friends.
No. I dont think so.
Yeah, hes the best.
Oh, I dont know.
I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep, I
Oh, yeah.
Its Rachel.
