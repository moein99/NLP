(entering with Phoebe) Hey!
We know its Ross!
Im gonna be an uncle! Come here! (He joins the hug.)
Well that, that sounds good.
Bye.
What secrets?
(whispering to Chandler) Youll tell me later?
Yknow, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
I dont have a key, they took mine to give to you.
Why would they take away our keys?
No thats not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
Hey, I washed those!
Yeah that didnt sound like me.
Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
Monicas chicken parm! Ill take care of it. (He picks up the phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, its Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandlers apartment. Its an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)
Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Really?
Yeah, I dont think thats what it is.
Oh wow, I dont feel well.
Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
What the hell is that?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
(eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)
So its noticeable huh?
(simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I cant believe that!!
How are you doing?
Well, what did you say to her?
(shocked) What?
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they dont even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)
Hey Monica its Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin from your apartment.
Yeah and wed go check it out, but you took away our keys.
How? I guess I could break down your door.
And-and you wont blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs up.)
Uh, okay Ill-Ill-Ill break it down. (He hands the phone to Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)
Hey!
I dont see the baby. Where is it?
