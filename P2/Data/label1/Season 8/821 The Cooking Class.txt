Man, this is bad! And Ive had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. (Quoting) "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And Im not just saying this because Im your friend, Im sayin it cause its the truth. Youre food is abysmal!
(entering) Hey uh Monica, I cant remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
Okay, Ill see you there. (Starts to leave)
Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What uhHow come youre not going?
I thought you already have a job.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
What is it?
You cooked him?
Either eat it, or be in it.
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; theres a new class comin in.
Hi.
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
Cheese makes me thirsty.
All right.
I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, Im a dork.
Yeah!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I dont want to go. Im having fun.
Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says its time to go, its time to go. (Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade, and I didnt have to sleep with the teacher this time.
What the hell!
Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)
