Oh, its a poster for that World War I movie that Im in, check it out.
Uh-huh! I know. Im coming soon to a theater near you! Im in THX! Im unsuitable for children!
Yeah, yeah, its already generating Oscar buzz.
I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and youre all invited! (They all gasp.)
Sure! Why not?!
Hello?
One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Oh my God. So thats it?! I only get to bring one guest?
(to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
You said you didnt want to go.
Definitely not invisible.
Well uhI think I want to take Chandler.
Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself.
Thanks. That means a lot to me.
(in a manly voice) Im gonna go shave. (Gets up.)
A little tall.
Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)
(onscreen) "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
(To Chandler) Okay, this is it. Its my big fight scene coming up. (He looks over and Chandler and notices that hes asleep.)
You liked it? You really liked it?
Which part exactly?
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later. (Starts to walk out.)
Hey! Sleeping beauty!
(in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? Youve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything!
Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thats (Pauses to figure it out.)
Please!
All right, what else?
Which were still keeping under our hats!
What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) "The south will rise again man."
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
Okay. Okay, so Im writing you a check forSo you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
