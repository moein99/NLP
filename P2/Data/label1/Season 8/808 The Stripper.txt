Its a grand tradition!
This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. Hows it going?
Hot?
Im gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Will you let the lady talk?!
Yeah!
(on cell phone) Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. Okay? Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun.
How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
Thats her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)
Uh, that-thats-thats me!
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
Yeah, thats one naked hooker!
Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do.
Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.
I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
(on machine) Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually?
In a minute!
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
Hey! Its your bachelor party.
I dont want to. You do it!
You do it!
I miss this.
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Yknow now its likethings are different.
Oh sureAnd hey, dont get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I justI misshanging outjust-just us, yknow?
You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)
(on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! (Listens) What gives you the right to (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone and opens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone.
