(entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
(laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre not gonna be on TV!
Oh, youre switching apartments?
But Rachel has an apartment.
She is?
I guess I didnt really think about it.
Hey!
Oh, okay. II ate way too much.
Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was talkin to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
I was kinda hoping youd stay.
No room? Its a baby. Its like this big. (Holds his hands about a foot apart.) Yknow, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.) Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, its cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldnt even notice it. Wheres the baby? (Mumbles that its over in the corner.)
I could use a challenge! Its getting pretty easy.
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didnt have to change.
Yknow I blame Ross for this.
Im gonna miss you, youre the hottest roommate I ever had.
Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uhOh look! Heres a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. That-that-thats really just to show where the baby would go. Yknow why dont I hold on to him so that theres no confusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)
Im loud!
Im up all night!
Hello!
Look, if Im bringing home a woman who cant stand being around a baby, then maybe I dont want to be with that woman! Or maybe well just do it in the bathroom of the club!
Yeah! All rightLook, I know sometimes itll be hard, okay? But, itll also be reallyreally great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
Ohh!
I know! I found it on the street.
Yeah.
I dont know.
Ew.
Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)
Isnt that great?
