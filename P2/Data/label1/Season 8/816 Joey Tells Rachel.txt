Theres this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, its complicated. Shes with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, yknow? Ccause were really good friends.
Yeah, hes the best.
Oh, I dont know.
I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep, I
Its Rachel.
Yes.
Yes. I like Rachel.
(startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uhHey-hey, yknow, yknow who else I like? You! And it-it doesnt get said enough. I like you Ross.
Yeah, but its not a big deal.
Im an actor, yknow? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Look no, I-I know its bad, and I know its wrong. Okay? But-but its not like anythings ever gonna happen. Yknow? These-these are just feelings, theyre gonna go away.
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross dont
Hey.
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Oh what then? Kick me?
(getting worried) Bite me?
Oh nowHey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I dont
(pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uhI am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)
Anyway, it uhlook itll justtake me a while to get over her, thats all. Im not even sure how to do that, I mean Ive never been in love before so
Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I dont want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, Ill get over this." Yknow? I justIt just keeps gettin harder. I dont, I dont know what to do. Yknow? What do I do?
Okay thats the green stuff talkin.
But what if uhand Im not saying she will beBut
Are you sure?
Hey thanks.
Oh my God I have to tell her! I havent even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
Im sorry, youre right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!
Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as Rachel opens the door and startles him.)
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that Iwant to have dinner with you tonight. Thats all.
Okay. Thats good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what youre gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles Joey again.) Dont you people ever knock?!
What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason(Exhales slowly)Is it hot in here?
I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)
Uh How long have we known each other?
Uh-huh, long time.
But over the past few weeks
Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Im not quite sure.
Yeah, here we are. Uhh I I think Imfalling in love with you.
Im falling in love with you.
Does it really matter?
Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You dont have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay, you gotta say something!
But. (Hangs his head down.)
Yeah-yeah right. Thats okay. Thats fine. Thats uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, its no big deal. All right? I think Im gonna go. (Stands up.)
Dont start doing that. You cant do that Rach, cause then youre gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to her.)
Sure!
Hey-hey-hey, hey! You cant. Okay? Ever!
Oh no-no Rach, please, dont be sorry. Okay? Dont be sorry. (They hug again.) Yknow I was only kidding you.
