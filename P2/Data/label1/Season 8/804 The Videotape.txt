Hey! Youre back! (Hugs and kisses all around.)
A couple? Like two people? Like (points to himself) one (points to Phoebe), two people?
Yknow what? Why dont you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
Youre welcome buddy.
Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) Thats right.
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin to that place.
All right! Ill have a sandwich!
Oh I think we do.
Yknow what? Dont worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
Personal thing? What personal thing? I dont know.
(laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talkin about.
Hey.
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
Whoa, for like months?
Six months? Whoa thats rough.
The skys blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Okay. Okay. UmmOoh! Oh-oh, I got something. Its this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; theyre like putty.
Okay. Now youre gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe
Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)
I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly) And across the lake I sawa beautiful womanbathing herselfbut she was crying
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Hey! Look, if it didnt work its because you didnt tell it right! Show me how you did it.
How long since youve seen a girl naked?
Im not feeling it.
No! No! No Ross! Im not hot! Are you hot?
Well youre not selling the story! Its like; its like you dont believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when Im preparing for an audition. Okay? Ill set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what youre doing wrong.
All right now All right, youre all set up. Youre good to go. Just hit record. All right?
Good luck.
Yeah?
(trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)
Yknow what? This is not fair to her. Lets just forget the tape!
Youre right. (Mouths, "I know youll show me, right?)
Loud and clear! (Mouths, "Youll show me," and nods.)
Yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt give you real names either.
Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Uh no Rach, hes gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
(confused) Are we watchin the tape or not?!
(To Phoebe) Im so happy!
How do you know about that story?!
(raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)
(raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!
