(thinking) All right. Its a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you dont feel that now. It was crazy! Youre fine. Youre better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everythings normal! Shes just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
(thinking) Hey, its your girlfriend, Rachel!
(entering) Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
Well, neither.
I dont know. Its-its justlately, Ive been feeling Okay, heres what it is (Pause) You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks! (Starts to leave)
All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but thats different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
Yeah.
You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
Hey. Well, whats up?
What?
Whaaat?
Oh my God. You do?
I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, its Rachel for God sakes.
I know. I know. And shes not only my friend; shes my pregnant friend! Shes my pregnant friend whos Ross ex!
What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, yknow? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I dont like about her. You want to hear it?
She made me switch to light Mayo. Thats it! Thats all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
You think?
Yeah, just a crush! Thats all this is! Its a crush! Im Joey; I dont get deep feelings.
Not really.
(from outside the bathroom) Hello?
Why?
(entering the bathroom) What are you guys doing in here?
Its no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. Its just a crush! Its going to go away! (Looks down) Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
(thinking) All right. Its a new day, and its just a crush, thats all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everythings going to be fine. Its just a crush.
(thinking) I love you.
