Look, Ill come to the party but Im not dressing up.
No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone youre not
That hot girl from their wedding?
Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huhOoh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw MassacreNo-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
(entering) Hey!
Yes I did! Im Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?
Okay. Im Chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.)
When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.)
(sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
Yeah.
Exclusively.
Catwoman, hands down.
But between you and Phoebe, Id have to give the edge to Phoebe.
Are you kiddin? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, shes got this crazy temper. SheShes not standing right behind me is she?
Im not sure.
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesnt matter.
I would say, "Woman, please!"
(To Monica) Here comes the temper.
Okay, heres a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.
So Ross?
(To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
So you think Ross too?
Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to see a fight, lets give em what they came for!
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Rach?
(entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! Were waiting! (They go inside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. (They grasp each others hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
(laughing) Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
Or equally weak.
(to her) Youre a weird lady.
Hey!
Thats not so bad.
Come on! Youre good with kids. Theyre just crazy on Halloween. Yknow, theyre all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmasand their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime theyre hungry or sleepy. Yknow, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)
