Oh hey Rach, listenHi!
Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren
No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, shes really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, yknow, to give her some advice.
Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
Okay, so will you meet with her?
Great! Thanks! Youre gonna love her so much. AndOh, shes the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, yknow the S.A.Ts?
She took em!
(entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
My little sister Dina!
This is so exciting for her. Well, Ill let you two fashists get down to business. (Exits.)
Hey! Its my fashion girls! (They dont react.) Whats wrong?
(concerned) Oh. Whats, whats going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dads heart? Is that a sandwich?
Is that a sandwich?!
(angrily) What?!
Well obviously this is a mistake! You cant be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
(to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) I cant believe this! Youre the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
You got pregnant for funny?! Dinaif hes funnylaugh! All right, Ill be back in a little while! You stay here!
I cant look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.)
Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman
Dont interrupt me when Im talkin to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man
Oh youll take em!
Hey! You dont get a say in this!
Ahhh! I heard "I do", were halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby) You!
Well what am I supposed to do?
No they cant! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Lets hear their plan! Now, whats the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
(to Dina) You were right. He is funny.
Dina, if youre having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, thats not a compliment!
So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? Youre gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourselfwithout a husband?! You cant be a single mother alone! Youre gonna ruin your life!
No! No! No! Its different for you. Youre so strong and together. Youre not some dumb kid who doesnt know what shes doing.
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Thats right! By his uncle too!
Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)
