Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. (Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesnt move from his chair.)
Im missin picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at him and he retreats.)
(To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!
Hey-hey-hey, hey thats your wife youre talking about!
Who was that?
You hung up on the pizza place? I dont hang up on your friends.
Oh, whats wrong?
Then why did I ask?
Is that college talk for horny?
Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)
(entering) I cant do it!
Youre Rachel!
Youre my friend!
But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
I know!
Do you wanna do it?
All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
This conversation never happened!
Good night!
Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)
