(hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! Thats Rachel!
No-no, I cant! I cant! Not after the other night, its just itstoo weird, okay? Dont tell her Im here! (Turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Dont eat that! (Runs to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)
Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler) Dude, I dont know. Thats a pretty small hole.
I cant! Yknow? You guys dont know what its like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
All right so, so what do I do?
Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your
Hey.
Hi.
(entering) Hey!
So you uh, have abig work problem?
Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think Im gonna take off.
Yeah?
Yeah?
What?! Oh my-oh my God!
What he wants to buy your baby?!
Thats crazy!
Okay, how did this even happen?
Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
(entering) Hey!
Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guys not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
Lets just say I took care of it.
Dont worry! Dont worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You dont go buying peoples babies, so back off!!"
What?! Why?!
And you couldnt think of anything else?!
You lied to me!
So? What-what-what happened?
I know. I know.
Hey youre right. Yeah, its kinda been like us again a little bit.
Me too. I mean Ihavent thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didnt feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
