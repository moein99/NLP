Hey! You made it!
Youre ready to have a baby? My boys all grown up!
(voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!
God. Hes crazy! Why doesnt he want to be with Rachel?
I mean seriously, shes like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadnt and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and (Realizes everyone is staring.) I havent bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
(looking at her) No.
All right.
Hey I got one! I got one!
(standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)
(walks up) Uh, shes with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.
Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a doctor.
Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?
Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years!
816, thank you!
And what is his name?
Great! Go get him.
(looks in the window) Hes not really my type.
But you said he was this great guy!
You do attract some stinkers.
Hi! Im Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
I know, but Im a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
Date of birth?
Age?
Im a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
Okay. And uh, are you married.
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
(checking the list) Yes.
Oh thats terrible. Im-Im really sorry.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff yknow, sexually?
Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)
Uh, well hes 33.
A widower.
He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and hes not into anything weird sexually.
(entering) Rachels having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at him.) Which is of no interest to me, Im a neurologist.
Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)
Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brothers triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
Right!
Me neither.
There she is!
(taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Yknow what I mean! Shes this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees anduh-oh.
Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so were good.
Whats the matter now?
What was the other one Ross?
Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. (Notices shes wiping her eyes.) Whats the matter?
What is it? Hey!
Rach come on, what?
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, listen to me, listen to meyou are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise thats not gonna happen.
You dont have to worry about that okay?
Sure.
My God.
