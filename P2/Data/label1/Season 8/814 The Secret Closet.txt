Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, were almost there! Were almost there!
Oh, I love you too.
Thats always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
What? Whats going on?
Aaaah
Really?!
Oh, yknow what? Maybe uh, youyou should come to me. Im a not, Im not wearing any bottoms.
Oh my, oh my God!
Mia Hamm?
Oh thats amazing. (Drops the sheet.)
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
A dreamless sleep.
Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.
Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Why not?
I dont know. Ooh, I bet its Richard.
Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Yknow it wouldnt kill ya to respect your wifes privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the door.) Stupid closet full of bugs!
Oh hey whoa-whoa, dont worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Absolutely. But, were gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? Ill page Ross on the way. Come on.
Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everythings gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing bones!
Hey! So?
So but everything is normal.
And-and theres no danger to her and the baby?
Calm?! I wasnt calm! Ive never been more scared in all my life!
Well what do I know?! Im not a doctor!
You sure?!
(seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Hey uh, whats with the candy?
Oh hey, dont worry about it man. Dont worry about it, no big deal.
Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He brought Twizlers!
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Then why do you throw like one?
Sure. "Monica."
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I justI wish I didnt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkI think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Im just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
Yeah.
Oh, I justI feel terrible.
Whats going on?
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Im on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
The thing iscause I live with Rachel Im here for a lot of the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And RossRoss is missing everything. So
Maybe you two should live together.
Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatif youre gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father.
All right now, so? What do you think?
Well, I was due.
Hey.
Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, so its got a bit of a kick.
Are you kidding me? Im great! Yeah, Im uh; Im better than great. I am good. And now that shes gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldnt do before. Yknow? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Yknow? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Yknow? I like being on my own, Im uh, better off this way. Im uh, a lone wolf. Yknow? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. Whats a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)
