(To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Ooh, great! Thanks!
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya
Hey, yknow what?
Why dont I take you out?
Yes I do! And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
Ill be fun.
No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands her some flowers.)
And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half a brownie. Actually, its just bag. Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so
Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, sonice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
Yknow what? Bring her both, and Ill have the same. (The waitress leaves.)
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? Were on a date.
No! No. Umm, just myself and if they dont like me for(Laughs.) Im sorry I couldnt even get through that.
Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but youre so beautifulI dont think I can.
Alright, soso tell me one of your moves.
Thats your move? Boy Rach, youre lucky youre hot.
(exasperated) Queens.
Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
I dont know. I guess theres just always been this distance yknowI mean we both try to pretend its not there, but it is.
Yeah, it is. Its really tough. Yknow sometimes I thinkWow!! Nice move!
"Whered you grow up," its so simple!
Yeah.
Yes I am! Again so simple!
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Chandler?
Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
I never laughed so hardDid you see the wine come out of my nose?
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
Huh. Huh.
Ah! Okay, well then you dont judge me. Im gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)
Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
Now you cant tell anyone, but uhI put on shiny lip balm.
Yeah, like a moth to a flame, Im telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
Why not?
More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at him.) I didnt say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
(stunned and turned on) Yeah. WhyYeah, that would work for ya
Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then starts to freak out.)
Hey!
Oh yeah, I still cant believe you havent seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Oh yeah? All right, lets do it tonight.
Oh right!
Yeah.
Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Yeah me too, all night.
Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper.
Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
No-no! Im fine. Its just Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that youve known for a while and then suddenlysuddenly see them a different way?
You mean like from behind?
Yeah. Yeah, thatthats exactly it. Youre right. Yeah.
Ew, yknow what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
(deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what Im talking about.
Totally! Wow! (Pause) Would you excuse me for a sec?
Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches her go.) Ehhh.
(incredulous) Alone?!
Hey, did you get to the part where theyre trapped in the car and Cujos throwin himself at the windshield?
Oh uh, it didnt work out.
Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)
