Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
(laughing) You fall for it every time!
I just want you to say it once in a while.
What?!
Phoebe!
No theyre not! Theyre ugly and stupid and delicious!
She is?
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
Thats right! Cause Im a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin chips is like stretching.
Dont worry, Tribbianis never get full.
(To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?
Oh hey!
Thats it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
(quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?
(To Rachel) Its like me when I was born.
(To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?
Im afraid Im gonna need proof.
You are my Everest.
Oh yes I do. Otherwise whats next? Today Im just a guy who cant finish a turkey, but tomorrow Im the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I justI justI gotta change my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)
(entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right wheres that turkey!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
Well thats it. Im done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.) A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the knife again.) What?! Are you afraid youre gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
