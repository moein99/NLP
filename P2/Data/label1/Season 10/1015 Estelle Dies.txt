Hey, great! All right!
What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and Rachel follows him)
Hey Phoebe.
I’m just mad at my agent.
There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.
Well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
Ok. Why?
I love that saying!
Hello?
I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.
Yeah, actually I am!
That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.
I’m saying that… (pause). This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).
Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.
Why?
(impressed) You blow me away.
I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops herself from laughing and leaves)
Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello?
Estelle?
(still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
No, no, no! (Starts looking around the room, terrified) Don't drop by, don't drop by!
Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display) "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (Joey looks at the photograph) ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey looks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's nothing left in his mouth.)
