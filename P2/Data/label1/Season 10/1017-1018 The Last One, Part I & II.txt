Hey!
It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
Oh my God. You and Rachel?
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
So, so is she still going to Paris?
Okay.
I bet you did!
Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Oh my God! What did you say?
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Hey!
Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Ross, wait!
Could you get me a muffin?
Hey, you know what might help?
It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
No, I sat in the paint.
Why not?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Damn it!
You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
(To Monica) Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. (Looks at Phoebe) Right?
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
What?
Really?
Yeah, you are!
This is so cool!
But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
Good luck, good luck!
Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
Alright!
Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
Oh!
You stepped on my egg roll?
Just put it on a plate and leave.
Alright.
Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
Oh! They're in the table!
We gotta get them out of there!
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Oh!
Oh God! So what do we do?
Okay.
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Oh my God!
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
It did not.
(yelling) Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
Okay. Here goes.
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Yeah.
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
What?
I could get a goose!
Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
I love you!
Hey!
So did you guys make it in time?
Has it always been purple?
Yeah. I guess so.
