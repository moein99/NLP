Hey! Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!
(Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!
No.
Cool!
That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
(after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!
Oh! Any word on casting yet?
What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
Thank you. (he sits down)
Damn it! (he leaves)
Just pass it to your boss!
What's up?
(sounds disappointed) Oh.
(looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched the tape?
(sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation)
Keep going Pinocchio!
(yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards his room)
You still here?
Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!
(very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? (goes back into his room)
(comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)
(Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).
(enters from his bedroom) What?
I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
But it's an original Buffay...
Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
Now, what do you say?
And?... AND?
Gladys?
You're mean!
