Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.

Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?
(offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
