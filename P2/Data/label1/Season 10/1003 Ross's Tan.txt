Yeah. It's actually our first official date
Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
(pause) It's OK!
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)
More foosball?
I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems puzzled) Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!
Yeah.
Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
What’s the matter?
Okay
I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!
Ok.
(a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you?
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Ok, yeah, got it.
Okay.
This thing welded shut?!
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
Sorry!
I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
(contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said) NAH! I don't have another level!!
Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).
(To Rachel) Hey!
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
Oh! yeah!
uh uh!
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
(He just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) Soldier down!
Well, I know what's the matter with me.
I don't know.
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
That's a... pla-an.
(sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
So...
I love ya.
Yeah, me too.
Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
