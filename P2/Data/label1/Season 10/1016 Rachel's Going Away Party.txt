All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
Just flip!
Damnit!
Hey!
At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?
Try it, I can't feel a thing! (Ross starts punching him too)
You guys hear a ringing?
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
(entering the room) Hey.
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
What did I just say?
You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. (he stops and starts realizing something) Wait a minute...
I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
I really made you think about that thing uh?
(still very emotional) Lucky bastard!
All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)
Yeah.
Who's that dirty old lady?
Come on here, have a seat.
Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
A little more.
A little more, a little more. (she stuffs some more down his pants and Joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.) A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
(in pain) Doesn't work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor)
