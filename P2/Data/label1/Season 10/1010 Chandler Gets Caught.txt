Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
(walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
(to Chandler) You son of a bitch!
I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
(clearly shocked) What?
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)
Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can!
What the hell are you doin'?
(he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!
I put it on to scare Chandler!
It smells really bad in here.
It's Joey.
(shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
Oooooh!
Big fat goalie.
Weekend at Bernie’s.
Everyday use.
Guest.
Uhh, 11!
Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
(panicking) Dude! He's right there!
Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
I'm really sorry you guys.
You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)
(speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) What did they say?
