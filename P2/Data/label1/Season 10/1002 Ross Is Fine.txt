Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
Rach, he just saw us.
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
Dude, chill! (to Ross) Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
Yeah, but it did happen, so...
Ross?
Yeah.
No, no, no!
Probably.
No, no!
Really?
Ross..
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
I do like fajitas.
Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
In a carriage!
Hey, Charlie!
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Oh. Oh, thanks.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
Uh, actually, that's..
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
Dude, are you okay?
You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
It doesn't look good, does it?
Morning. Here you go.
Yeah.
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
That's what I hear, yeah.
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
I'm crazy about her.
I think so.
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
And we're okay?
