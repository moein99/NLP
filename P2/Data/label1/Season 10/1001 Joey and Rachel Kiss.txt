Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
No idea what it means.
I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Is he gone?
Pssst...
Well, he's with Charlie now.
(long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
(turns around very fast) I like although!
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
I'm thinking about you...
Let's forget about Ross...
What's wrong?
Seriously... What is it?
What's wrong?
Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)
Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
I understand...
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Ooh...
I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Hey!
Yeah?
You kissed.
I saw you.
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
Yeah... Now I have something...
Oh... uh... look... before you...
I am those things, yeah.
Dude!
I can't think of anything.
Yeah.
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
Hey!
So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)
Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)
Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)
Stop saying good night.
