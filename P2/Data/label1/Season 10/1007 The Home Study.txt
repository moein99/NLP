Hey!
What's going on?
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
(pointing at himself) Celebrity.
(going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
(form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it back in his face) OW!
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
Guys!?
What's going on?
Everything doesn't sound fine!
Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
(quivering with anger) I did not care for that!
Ok, ok! (He leaves)
I forgot my bat.
(to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the apartment, leaving her shocked)
(acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him)
LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)
