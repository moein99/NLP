Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together thats (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.
Hi!
Oh thats on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Well, hes not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with himHe says its okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! Im getting more dates than ever!
How about a scone on the house baby?
Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin?
(to a customer) Are you all finished here?
Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)
What?!
Well if its free food, how come youre charging me for it?
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
(to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)
Thatll be $3.85.
Its just I cant because my manager said I (Gets an idea) (Starts singing) "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie
(still singing) "Amy! Happy birthday to you!"

(singing) "Happy birthday to you!"
What? No-no its her birthday!
But it really
Damnit! (Storms off.)
(overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!
