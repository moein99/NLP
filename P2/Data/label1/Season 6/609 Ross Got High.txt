Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
(frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and theyre gonna be, be drinkin and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Rach, youre killin us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
Y-sure!
(faking dissapointment) Okay.

(turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!
(sad) Oh man! Now shes gonna start all over! Were never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
(shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are funny...
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
(frustrated) Still not hot enough!
(to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janines friends are dancers?! And that theyre going to be drinking alot!?
Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster?

Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.

(scolding) Dude, theyre not objects.
Just kiddin, Ill talk to them, you distract Rach.

Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?
Rachel, there you are! Come on, lets serve that dessert already!
