Hey.
Sure, neighbor come on in.
Uh, no, shes at dance class.
Yeah, but, hey look, dont go through her stuff. She gets really mad.(Chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)
(Looking around the room.) It is???
No.
No.
(With Big Eyes.) All right, youre right. Ill talk to her.
Im a man.
(Grunting) Hmm. (Monica opens the front door and comes in.)
Or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. (Everybody gets up.)
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Yeah, thats what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhhLook Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. Itstoo girly.
Like this. (pointing to the picture) Pictures of cute babies we dont know. We..we cant have that.
Look I dont know this baby. I dont know if shes a famous artist or not. You know, and I dont want to be a jerk but youre changing too much around here.
Yeah but its too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Im sure its a famous watering can, okay. But, come onand what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
Ohh, well, thats ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. Its up here on some hook..andsmells different.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towelsAlso what is with these chips you bought?
(Voice cracking) Well thats like summer in a bowl.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. Were knitting pot holders.
So whats really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)
What?
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers theyre just, you know, theyre nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean.
Its not what you said. Its the way you said it.Oh My God, Im a women!!!
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Im sorry but weve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? Thats just the way it has to be.
GreatGreatand thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didnt want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all the girlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
(Smiling) Okay.
