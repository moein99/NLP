Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
That sounds perfect!
Youre gonna mess it up let me do it.
Hey!
Hey Rach!
Where are you going?
Hey, yknow what? Ill come too. Im making money now; its about time I give something back.
Okay. Have a benefit.
Thats not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)
Its the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
(behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his way for the shrimp toast.)
Hey!
I won! That was my guess!
I guessed 20,000!
What?! I dont have 20,000!
I didnt know it was an auction!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
I dont know! Charity?
Oh hi!
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
(To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I cant buy the boat, I dont have any money.
So uh listen, I think Im gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I dont have that kind of money!
Okay.
Look, I dont know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Yknow? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
(To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the talking.)
You-you have to pay that! Its not just a guess.
Are you kidding me?! Shes gonna this boat!
Aw-awww!
Oooooh
No way! Its mine!!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Who cares?! I-Ill make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Oh my God, youre back!
Yeah.
What?! Noooo (Phoebe gasps.)
We didnt ruin it!
Glove salesman!
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)
That guys still doing that?!
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each other.) I never noticed that before.
Hey!
(laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.
(all excited) The Mr. Bowmonts here!!! (Jumps over the back off the couch and runs out into the street.)
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
Hey Monica!
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Whoa-whoa, whats the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Well, you know Chandler.
Maybe you changed?
Maybe thats the problem.
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
I dont know! (All excited) I havent totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
There are?
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!
Chandler loves marriage!!
You got that from what I said?!
Where the hell have you been?!
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Yeah! Yeah, Ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldnt keep flying off!
I know! They suck!!
I know!
Look, Chandler I dont think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Yeah!
Okay.
Dude-dude-dude!
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
(entering) Hey!
Phoebe! Were both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!
No we werent!
Pick me!!
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Okay thats fair.
Yeah.
Dude!
Shes gone.
Shes gone. She had a bag and she left.
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldnt believe me.
To her parents I think and she said you shouldnt call her. But if I were you I would.
I am so sorry man.
(yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! Were dying out here!
Yeah!
