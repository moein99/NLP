(entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Hey!
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isnt that why you guys are here?
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Mornin Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Nah, Im too depressed to eat. Ill probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess Ill just fly home with you guys, what times your flight?
I dont need that anymore.
I dont want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. (Gets an idea.) Ohooh! How about you come with me?
Itll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
Sure?
Hey.
Where is the waitress?! Im starving!
Oh, heres where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the buffet table with Chandler in tow.)
Sure! Whats up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)
Oh my God! Thats huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I wasnt invited? And who was going to be your best man? Dont say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Oh! Tell her shes not marriage material.
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if shes anything like me, shes just gonna be relieved.
They let you get married when youre drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
An annulment? Ross! I dont think surgerys the answer here.
(wakes up) What?!
All right. All right.
Really? I dont
(starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)
(to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)
Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Ooh, Ill play! Ill play!
Come on Pheebs! I cant take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didnt deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? Ive got a really good one! Ive been thinking about it since Kansas.
Yes.
That is incredible! You are the master!
What are you doing?
I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)
Im not finished.
