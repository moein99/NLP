(To Ross) What is the matter with you?!
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel) Who-whos Barry and Mindy?
Ohh-oh, wasnt he cheating on you with her?
(starts to imagine it) I cant. I keep seeing it the good way.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, theres Carol again!
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
(not impressed) Wow!!
Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)
Hey.
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Really?
Thats an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
Thats great! That would be great! Lets do that!
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I dont need any assistance in there, take a break!
(holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know, here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)
(shaking Rachels hand) Hi!
Well, its always nice to meet the fans.
(turning and whispering to Monica) Shes not crazy is she?
(To Rachel) So uh, how you doin?
(entering) Hey there you are!
All right, heres a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work Im delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits.)
(entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
All right, and over there is Bradys Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. (Points at a large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Why? (In Drakes voice.) Why cant the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drakes voice) I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, theres pulp in that. (Hands it back.)
I thought we talked about this. I dont like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isnt juice. All juice, okay?
Oh my God, Im sorry, Im being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.) Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
(To Chandler) Iced tea.
(To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?
(To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares at him.) Youre gonna throw that juice at me, arent ya?
(entering) Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know youre mad, but I just want to say Im sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Yknow? I mean, yknow how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say Im sorry. Here. (Hands him a cup.)
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Oh my God! Thats great! Congratulations! Whats the story?!
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? Cause I think I read it!
I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on polls. Youll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.
(climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do youready for a refill?
Pretty cool, huh? But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.
Its uh, right through there. (Points.)
Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Yeah you did.
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Come, come here.
(entering) Morning!
Yeah.
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Wh-why?
Thats ridiculous! Im not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me
Wow! Uh okay, well uh (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)
Sure! As long as they dont find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, youve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didnt. And thats what this ring stands for.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Hey!
All right!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Youre not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
(not quite sure of how to answer that) Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carols great and Im sure youre a very attractive man, but I.
You?
Wow!
All right! So, was it amazing?
Just okayDid you do it right?!
Huh. But still Ross, youre worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Yknow what I mean?
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Not the other one?
Yeah, you dont want that.
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
You got a little bored?
Yeah? What did ya have?
Sounds good.
