Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and shocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Great! Roomie!
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya?
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, Ill take a check for the other hundred.
Of course Im jokin! I dont take checks.
Oh, Im sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Ooh! So close.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, hows it going with her?
Huh.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar?
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
No! No! No! For my new fridgeour new fridge!
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
(pause) Give me $400!
Or! You can just, yknow (He walks up close to whisper in Rosss ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Oh-ho-ho, you think I dont know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! (He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! Thatll be $400!
(pause) You pushed him!
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
I still havent gotten a check for your half yet.
Im not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
(entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Really?!
Call it even?
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Sure! I was there! Spring Break 81! Woo-hoo!
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And yknow who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
(entering) Hey!
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
