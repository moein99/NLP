The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna make it!
No! I wont leave you!
No youre not! Not to me!
What?
Yeah, youre great! Okay, lets take it from
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Yknow what? I think thats enough for now. Yeah. I dont want to be over rehearsed.
Oh, its a new TV show. Yeah. Im up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, Im a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. Hes a, hes a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Thats the title! Yeah! Yknow they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Well, dont get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just dont know if Im good enough.
You really think so?
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where it looks like he's smelling a fart.)
(there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..." (Does the smell-the-fart look.)
(on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)
I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt. Monica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God. Joey: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! Ross: You're right, you're right, it is.
All right well, Im outta here. Wish me luck.
Yeah, whatever. (Exits.)
(entering, dejectedly) Hey.
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldnt even be an actor!
Yeah, did I fool ya?
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Yeah-yeah, its down to me and two other guys.
And I know both of them, theyre really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials whos always getting chased by those big flowers
Im just so nervous! Yknow? The callback isnt until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Theres just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I dont know if youd understand.
I want this part so much! Yknow? If I dont get this part Im never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!No, I didnt say that! Thats a lie.
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
(on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? The auditions not til 5:00! (Chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as Joey listens.) Well, nobody told me! (Listens) Whod you talk to? (Listens and turns around to see Chandler trying to finish the message.) Nevermind! (Hangs up.)
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part couldve turned my whole career around!
Hey, you dont even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
What?!! Thats even worse!!
I dont know! But its the same!
Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Name one!
(getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt think big enough to fit a grown man!
I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what Im gonna do?
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
I said name one!
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)
Hey!
What message?
What?! Its 6 oclock!
I cant believe this Chandler!
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Oh, well Im uh
Oh wow! Okay man, Im sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
(shocked) Thats mean! You really had me going there!
Yeah, youre right. Okay look, listen, lets talk about what a huge star Im gonna be!
You hug me!
Hey, do we do this too much?
Yeah.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., Im not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then Ill just have to carry you.
Ross, you dont have to yell.
Yknow what? I think thats enough for today. Thanks for your help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)
