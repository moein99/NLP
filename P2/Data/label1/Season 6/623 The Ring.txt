Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)
Oh, Im sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)
No.
Yeah.
Oh, were supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Oh wow thats a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther Chandlers card.) Yknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI dont get Chandler. Yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get all upset.
All the time!
(entering) Hey!
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, "Whats going on?") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)
Yes, its in my Inin my pocket. (Paul hasnt dropped him yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Come on! Itll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and Paul probably
No! He blew us off!
I know!
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
I like it!
From now on, its gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake hands.) Okay! Were gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
(To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Oh my God!!
And-and-and-and-and-and, and were gonna be friends again!
Oh its water under the bridge, forget it!
I think Im gonna cry!
(holding an empty tissue box) Wheres all the tissues?! (Throws the box down in disgust.)
