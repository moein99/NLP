(entering) Hey guys.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Lets go watch it at your place.
Chandler, Chandler, yknow what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
No, thats VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . Its like a lotta noise to me. I dont know
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havent really paid the bill
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).
Sure.
Not so much.
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.
Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.
Uh, I dont know. Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow? And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.
What?!
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
(sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back to bed.)
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.
Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
(to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.
You got it.
Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a whats wrong with you? look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)
Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if theyre in on a secret together.)
Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
No.
Yeah?
Its kind of embarrassing, yknow. I mean, I was an actor and now Im a waiter. Its supposed to go in the other direction.
I mean, the jobs easy and the moneys good, you know? I guess Im going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Okay, I guess it doesnt seem that weird.
See, now its weird again.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Yknow? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. Its all about turnover.
Oh, Im sorry, Ross. Ill get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, Ill toss in a free muffin.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, its a great part. Look, check it out. Im the lead guys best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. Im sorry, that seats saved.
Okay, maybe hes not his best friend, but 
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. Im sorry, that seat is taken.
No, no, I didnt mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
So, youd hire me, right?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Yeah, its for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. Its a very important issue in this months Playboy. Im sure you all read about it.
Not good, no. I didnt get the part, and I lost my job here, so 
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Thats great. Thanks Rach.
Im not answering that.
