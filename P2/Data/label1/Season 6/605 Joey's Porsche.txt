Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. (Looks at them) Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcribers note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche, Id have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther, these yours?
Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Theres a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)
Well, I didnt realize until I got home. I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Yknow what? Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)
Great! Thanks. (Exits.)
Yeah, its not mine.
Yeah, its (looks up and sees the woman) mine.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
(checks in the window to make sure it has them) Its got em!
(entering) Hey guys!
Hey babies! Oh, Im having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche Ive got the keys too, still there!
You should see the treatment I get when Im with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyre gonna start to think that I dont own it. So I figured Ill wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
And thats just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Sure!
Okay, take it easy.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now Im just polishing her up.
Yeah, but its my wax.
Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) Ill uh, save your parking spot.
Why not?
Yeah, so did I.
(entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his car back.
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?
Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to leave.)
Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her! (Storms out.)
Why isnt that valet back with my Porsche?
(to women passing him) Porsche.
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Hey! Its Porsche!! (Hes right yknow.)
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Hey! How you doin?
Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. Shes sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)
