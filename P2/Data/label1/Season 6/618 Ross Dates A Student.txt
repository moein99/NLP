Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Oh, cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, theres your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)
Oh, well think of it like this, when youre 90
No thats not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when youre 90 youll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Oh well listen, anyway shes directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
All right! Thanks! Youre the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
(angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Okay.
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
(to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Oh, how bad is it?
Chandler, is that (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler nods yes.)
Hey-hey listen (Chandler waves him away.)
When youre off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hey listen, so whens-whens my audition? I mean I know its Thursday, but what time?
Ah-ha!
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns around to see Chandler glaring at him.)
This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And uh thats where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)
I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)
This is where I keep the pizza. (Its the same location as before.) AndHey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in its spot.)
(in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it was the candles. Its very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh Uhh Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean whats more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
You couldnt do it?!
Ah whatever!
No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!
Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
I know.
All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and eats it.)
Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)
Oh, very funny. I dont know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesnt say anything until Joey figures it out.) You got me the audition?! Lets hug it up! (They hug.)
Thats right, all the ladies want to stay at Joeys.
Yeah.
Hey!
So?
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a second Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)
