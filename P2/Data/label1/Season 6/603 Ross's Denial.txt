(To Chandler) Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?!
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin uh, Im gonna have an extra room over at my place
Yeah, why dont you move in with me? Itll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursdays right?
Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.
I dont know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez! (Exits.)
Hey, whats up?
But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. (Shows him the paper.)
Yeah? I just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me. And whats more different than me; a guy whos not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.) Not just a hat rack my friend!
(exiting from Chandlers room with the new roommate) Everything on your application looks really goodOhh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.
That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) Im very safety conscious.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it youre right where you dont want to be! Back together!
Thats not gonna work out! Then shes gonna come home all weepy and youll be tellin her, "Oh thats okay. Youll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Here she comes. Hold on, Im gonna make your life much easier.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!
Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
(opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!
Come in. Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, Im gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Very good! Okay. G.
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, butbye-bye! (He ushers her out the door.)
