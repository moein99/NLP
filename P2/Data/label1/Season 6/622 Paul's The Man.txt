(nodding knowingly) Now youre thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Me too.
Oh man! (Hits Chandler)
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin up about something Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now hes just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, Ill
Hey! So Im back.
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesnt remember) Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.) Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, Im ready to go back up on the wall Im the star of a new TV show.
Oh well, its not on TV yet.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)
(entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
All right, lets get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)
WhatBut you saw the show!
Dry cleaners?
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-thats offensive to Russians.
Oh you should, its great.
Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up on the wall?
Oh, youre kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? Im an actor; Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) Youre the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)
I didnt do that! Who wouldve done that?!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did not go out with your wife! (The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)
Yeah.
Hey Gunther.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one? Im sorry.
Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)
