Hey!
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Well all right then, I guess I shouldnt get to excited about the fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
I came over here to tell you guys.
Okay. (They kiss.)
Okay. (They kiss.)
Okay, Im all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips? (She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)
Have you kissed her yet? Its awesome! I could do it forever! Yknow what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
(indignant) I was tired!
Hey! I made that for her!
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
And Chandler I cant believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get the wine right?
See ya tomorrow!
What?
What-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Blah?!
Uh, theyre like my best friends. Are you saying we cant hang out with them? Cause that would kinda be a problem.
I guess.
If you want, Ill sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Hi!
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually its just gonna be me again tonight.
Oh, shes uh-uh really sick.
Yeah, shes been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high fever, a nose problem Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Kay!
No-no, she really is sick!
Uh, yknow, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Well uh, she didnt want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. Im so sorry.
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, dont-dont be mad. Im sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Yknow? And it was our first date! Plus, shes really sick!
I know, but dont you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? Shell come around I promise.
(shouting) I can hear you!
(entering) Hey!
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Ha-ha, very funnyLook! I dont know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Thats right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
You dont think I know that!
Well, this-this-this was great. Didnt everybody have a great time?
Oh well then, good night!
See? Eh, wasnt that fun?
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)
All right, uh, weve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you cant treat them that way.
I know! I know! And Im going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They Theyre like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I I dont think we can be together. It just, it just cant work. It cant. (Starts to break up) Im very upset.
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.)
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah! (They head downstairs.)
How ya doin?
Pretty much, yeah.
Well, when its not right, you know it.
Yeah! Yeah. Ill be all right.
What?
(laughing hysterically) Youre right! That did cheer me up!
