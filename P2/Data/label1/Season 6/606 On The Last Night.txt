Right! And when is that due?
And thats every month?
Ahhh.
(looking at it) Oh my God!!
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charityanymore.
No! Forget it! OkayI mean thanks, but Im done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whats next? Come on.
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Hey!
I dont know Ross, not if youre gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
(quietly) Ive got Ben.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Oh thats okay. Hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
What, are you crazy? You havent beaten me once since my injury plagued 97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Okay, youre on.
(scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! Thats like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, theres nothing in the fridge.) Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.
You serious?
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Okay, here we go. Ready?
This sucks man! The last night youre here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Nah, not my game.
Well, whats it called?
I dont know how to play Cups.
All right.
A two and a five.
Really?!
A four and a nine.
No. Why?
Damn! I am good at Cups!
Well, what did you have?
Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.
Yeah.
What?
Really?
Hey!
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnt even get half a cup! Nothin!!
And he never played before either! Yknow what I think? I think beginners luck, very important in Cups.
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! Im serious this time! In-in fact, look, theres aI wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yknow, thank you for being such a great roommate.
Its him, not it!
Wait a second, I see what youre trying to do here! You-youre trying to give me money again!
Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I cant take care of myself. Okay? Look, Im not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that Im gonna missis you. And now the dog.
