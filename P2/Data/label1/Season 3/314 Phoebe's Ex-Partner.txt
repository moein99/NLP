Wow! This girl is good.
(to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
(to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?
(joining in) Home is Home Star stew.
(to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh! (hides behind the coat rack.)
Phew, close one.
(entering) Hey.
Is ah, is Chandler around?
Oooh.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasnt something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Aww, man. Thats the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out hes my roommate, shes gonna tell him what I did.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I cant, I cant tell you that, its like the most awful, horrible thing Ive ever done my whole life.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dads cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably shouldve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
I ran!!
(entering from his bedroom) Morning.
(to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin huh?
Listen, I ah, I know its a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Yeah. You okay?
Yeah.
Where have you been?
