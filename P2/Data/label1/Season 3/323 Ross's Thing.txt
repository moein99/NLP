Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.

Hi, how ya doing?
