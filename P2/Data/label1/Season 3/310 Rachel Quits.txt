And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
What? Me having a job?
Well, Im pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Sure.
All right.
Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Well, they go into the chipper.
(to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the cut it motion with his hands)
All right, Ill take a box of the cream filled Jesuss.
Look Rach, wasnt this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, youve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
(entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Not a problem.
And now for the great news.
Only if you think its better than this... (holds up an aerosol can) snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now its a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Yeah, the ah, trees that dont fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
(jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!
(simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!
