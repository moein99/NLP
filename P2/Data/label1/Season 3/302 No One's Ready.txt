All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes a glass from the fridge.)
(drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
We have a half hour.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Okay. (they don't move)
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Glass of fat?
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Am I in it?
Whoa!
What?
How is this your seat?
But then you left.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the bathroom). Soo...
All right! You can have the chair.
Oh my, would you look at that! (holds up crossed fingers)
Sorry Phoebe.
I'm so sorry.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Wow, what a cool job. (in a machine voice) 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Now she sounded breezy.
Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
(entering) Where's my underwear?!
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
You could drink the fat.
Yaaaay!
Let's see what else he'll do!
