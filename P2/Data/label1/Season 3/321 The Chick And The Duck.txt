Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincys theory. Okay?
Saw a girl with that vest.
(on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
(entering carrying a box) Hey!!
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Its cute, huh?
Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight, and talks to it like its a little baby.)
Hey.
Hows she doing?
Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?
Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
What?
Hey! Who was up from 2 oclock this morning until 5 oclock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Ohhh, here it comes.
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Thats not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I dont know, maybe we werent ready to have a chick.
Do you think well get our three bucks back?

(sees hes watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
What cha doing?
What about the chick?
Are you sure?
Sure.
(stopping him) Wait. Give him a minute.
