Hey!
No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Her what?
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Its just a game Mon. (makes a Can-you-believe-her face to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?
Hey-hey!
I know.
Oh, Im sorry. Did I get ya?
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Well, you shouldve told me that before, Im not a mind reader. Hey, were out of beer. Im going to Monicas.
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Nothing. Its just old and dingy, thats all.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.
Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)
(manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. Itd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)
Eh! There you go.
(yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
Ooh, very official.
Why dont we just go on two.
Because its faster.
All right, but in the future...
So we are going on two?
Wow, its big!
Maybe, my rulers wrong.
Look its not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Y'know what?
I bet ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)
Get out your checkbook, mister.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks are on me!
