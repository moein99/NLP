(to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Done.
So Pheebs whats this guy like?
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Yeah!
Uh, y'know what, were having second thoughts about our copying needs. And well need a little more time to think about it.
Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)
Well be there.
Uh, 10:30.
4:30.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
She was kidding about that right?
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Dude, I dont know.
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see something you dont want to be seeing.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?
Yeah, I guess, but whats like heads and whats tails?
So what are you gonna do?
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
