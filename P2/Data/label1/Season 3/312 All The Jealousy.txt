(hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
What?
Who?
The what?
Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what?
(singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Really? Thanks.
Excellent, I'll be there.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
(reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Whoa, I'm not done.
Done.
Mark's a genius!
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
So, does that mean the audition is off?
What?!
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Bye. (does the jazz hands)
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
People, people, people.
