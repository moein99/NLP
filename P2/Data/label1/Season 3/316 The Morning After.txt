(Voice Over) Previously on Friends.
Yeah. We figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.
Yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?
(stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, thats all. I mean, come on, its just a little wax.
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Dont answer that.
Awful! Horrible!
She was nothing compared to you.
Ewwwww!
Y'know what, I dont think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to open the door)
Why not?! (to Chandler) Im hungry.
Yeah, well be fine.
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.
Hey, thats not so bad.]
You think I need a new walk?
Well y'know, Ive been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a take notice walk.
Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a come on look.) Yeah, okay.
Maybe she killed him?
(whispering) No, I really have to pee.
