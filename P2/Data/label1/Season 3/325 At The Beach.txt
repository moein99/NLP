Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
What?
Okay, all right.
Fan out! Fan out!

Yeah, well, I couldnt find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
All right, relax. Its just a shoe.
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Actually, y'know its kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
