How long do you have to go for?
A year?!
Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
We were gonna go see the Jets!
I can't believe you guys are moving.
Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee)
(Laughs)
Uhuh.
(Laughs)
I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)
Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
Yeah!
(Laughs) Poophack... (Laughs)
(Laughs)
Hey!
(Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double date) Oh my God!
Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
No.
Mike.
Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
(Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)
Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in there!
MIKE!!!
(Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and sits down with him)
Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
Atta boy!
Okay, look...
(Laughs) From school.
Mike, 'attorney at law'!
What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!
Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)
What?!
(Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.) (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!
Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!
(To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?
Good night!
(Walks In)
Look at this. My two best friends!
I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)
(On the phone with Chandler) Double promise? Call me when you land.
Okay, bye. (He hangs up the phone.)
He had to board.
