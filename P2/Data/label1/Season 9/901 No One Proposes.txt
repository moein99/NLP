Uh Look Rach(Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look! Its my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but Im really more of a candy guy. (Laughs.)
No.
Oh, Im sorry. I meant no.
Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
(taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
Dude I just did something terrible.
No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
Because it kinda looked like I did.
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand
It wasnt my ring! It fell out of Rosss jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
I guess.
I know! I know its awful.
(happily) She said yes.
Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
Oh, I like that. Yeah
(laughs) Now lets not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)
(entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yknow what? Ill-Ill come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross whos entering.)
It cant be me, Im standing right here.
(To Ross) Were not peeking? (Follows him.)
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
Yeah uh look Rach, theres something I gotta tell ya.
(watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)
Dear Lord.
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that
Yknow, I dont really know her.
(To God) Are you kidding me?!
I dont know! Maybe shes crazy! (Storms out.)
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
I didnt look at it. Stupid babys head was blocking most of it.
Look, its not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I dont want to hurt her.
Youre right. Youre right. I-Ill go tell her now before Ross finds out and Ill be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.
I can come back.
No.
Actually, technically, I didnt.
No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
No, I didnt!
No, I didnt!
Ahhh!
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didntI didnt propose!
Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
No, I didnt!
No, I didnt!
Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
(To Ross) Ill tell you about it later. Be cool.
It wasnt my ring! Its Rosss ring! Thats why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
Dude, step up! I proposed.
Oh thats right. Theres a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
I cant believe youre not going to propose!
Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
(looking at the ceiling) Ah, its beautiful.
Yknow what you guys? Im uh, Im gonna go too. And uh, Im sorry about everything.
No, Rach, I shouldve told you sooner. Its just thatMan! That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)
