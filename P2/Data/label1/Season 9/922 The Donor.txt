So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Oh hey Rach!
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
(to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
What's the matter, Pheebs?
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
(to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)
Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Bye.
All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
So you're ruling out surrogacy?
So, I don't have to learn what that means?
Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Hello?
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Oh! How's it going?
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
Well, just wake him up!
Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
(impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Then don't go!
Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
