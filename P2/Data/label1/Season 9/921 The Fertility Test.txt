Hey!
Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being Joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) That's not how she used it...?
Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
(sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
Heeey!
Come on in, how are ya?
Can I offer you a drink?
Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!
Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
(looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!
I know, yeah!
Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
Which one, they all suck!
(looking puzzled) I don't think so.
Ross!
I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
(checking) EH, what do you know!
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
Thanks.
The Metsss!
(realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the right and Joey nods)
(gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Phonetically? (Looks confused)
Ok.
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).
Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
Hey!
(to Charlie) You're ready?
(aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) I made it work.
