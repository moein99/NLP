(entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Mmh-mmh.
Barbados!
All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)
(to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
That... never happens...
No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
(thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
You really should have been more clear about that!
Hey!
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
(smiling) Will you wear a thong?
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
No, why?
Oh man!
I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)
Hey guys!
Damnit!
Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh! Secret teapot?
It's really gone?
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
(stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
(walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba...
Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)
In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
There it is, you're blushing!
You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)
Tell me who it is.
Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
(eagerly) Yeah, who is that?
Yeah.
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
Yeah. (they leave)
Night.
He said "erectus"!
No, he really said it.
Erectus?
Yeah, and so funny!
Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)
(disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
(interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)
(bewildered) Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
Yeah... I think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?
(downhearted) Hey...
Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
(laughing sarcastically) Ok, Rach!
I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... (sighs) What the hell is my problem? OH! (He falls back on the bed)
(sitting up again) I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)
(stands up) No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
You like me? (shuts the door)
(shocked) That's a huge thing!
What... for how long?
(outraged) A MONTH??
(stands up) I just have one question!
(desperate) What the hell are you doin'???
Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
CURIOUS GEORGE (see link)! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
Yeah, he had a paper route.
No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
(charmed, but then recoiling) NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! (sighs) I couldn't do it to Ross!
I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) I'm sorry...!
NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
NO BIG DEAL!
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
