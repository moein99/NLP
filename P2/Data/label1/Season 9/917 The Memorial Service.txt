Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!
Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
(he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)
(after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)
Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)
(still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
(placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie... (to Emma) This isn't over.
Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Make the transfer! (She does so)
Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
But he's the same.
But he's the same.
He's the same!
(to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!
Original or crappy?
No, sorry haven't seen him.
It's Monica, ok?
Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
... she's being unreasonable!
It does?
Really? She... she loves me?
Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
How do you think I got him in the first place?
