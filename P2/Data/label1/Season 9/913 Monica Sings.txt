Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I should have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
On...?
Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Arghhh! Double standards!
Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
Chandler Bing.
OK Thanks. (Joey touches the hot wax). I touched the stuff
Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Oh good...
All right let's just do this.
Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right! Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK (He tries to avoid the tweezers) Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
Hey, I need your help.
Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped
You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one eyebrow and now... they don�t match!
All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so I don�t look stupid for my pictures.
What the hell am I supposed to do!
What, what.
Oh my God!
Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymore plucking. It hurts so bad!
Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the saloon
Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Thank you so much.
Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
Comb my eyelashes.
Hey!
Ha, oh, of course.
Your eyebrows look weird.
