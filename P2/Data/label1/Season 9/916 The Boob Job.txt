Hey!
I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.
Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Oh...how much?
Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters)
Hey!
Oo...what's in the bag?
Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
You're gonna do it?
Oh, women can. You can't.
The hardware store is right down the street.
Hey!
I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Yeah, I know.
Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
(to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is. (shrugs)
(To himself) I am on fire!
Listen...this is really nice. Do you... (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
Err... Kind of.
Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
Something personal.
Boob job.
Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
Rach?! (He walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened either) Rachel!!!!? (He walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet seat cover. It won't come up.) So I can't do anything I like????
Because she is!
Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
(voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... (He takes a box out, about to close fridge, then thinks.) Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
