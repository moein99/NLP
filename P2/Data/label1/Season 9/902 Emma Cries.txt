(Enters) Hey you guys Im gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
(He looks around the room) This isnt the right room, sorry folks. (leaves)
Whyre you so tired?
You know what you shouldve done, you should have told yourself that little story.
Hey so wheres Ross?
Is he still mad at us?
Thats not fair! I cant do that.
See this is what I was afraid of, I didnt think I should be here either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said hed be over it by now.
(entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing its Joey he just ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know youre pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didnt even do anything wrong.
I said I didnt technically.
Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I dont really know what that means. (Ross just looks at him) You were saying?
I know I shouldve. (Makes quote marks again.) "Im sorry."
No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he cant leave) Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
No, look, I dont know what else to do. I said Im sorry!
You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
Why not? Youll feel better! Ill feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
A little bit.
Little bit.
(excited) A little bit more.
No, hit me
Hit me.
Hit me!
(interrupting) Hit me, hit me.
(shouts) Hit me! Hit me!
Im sorry! It was a reflex!
I couldnt help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesnt and Joey punches Ross. Gunther is amused.)
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didnt you duck?
Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while were there, they can check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes quote marks.) "Oops."
Hey, so how is it?
Your thumb? Thats weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure youre punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
You, you want me to help you with that?
Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but whats it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
Its pretty, Okay date of birth?
Sure, May...tember.
Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, youre gonna get together right?
But you two were supposed to be together.
Come on, Ross, that didnt mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
So?
Wow.
Really?
And youre Okay with that?
Hey, for what its worth, with Rachel I dont think youll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."
(makes quote marks) "Thanks."
You know, ah, Ive been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, its not my fault. Its a natural instinct.
Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler, he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and just stares at Joey.)
