Morning, roomie!
Fifth day's a charm.
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
No, hey, it's been great.
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
Wow! So, how are you?
Really?
Well, actually it...
Wow, really?
Sure, I know lots of girls.
Ooh, names?
Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Why are they doing this?
You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
Ooh, that's a great plan!
Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
Hey.
All right! Who is he?
Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
Oh my god, you're right!
She even reads for pleasure!
What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
Ooh...I hear that's bad.
Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)
Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
Hello?
Emma? Hey! Hi!
How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
Why the hell did you take her?
Because you two were having sex!
Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.) You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
Hey, I gotta! Unless...
Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
(BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.
Uh-huh.
It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
Where?
Can you believe they're still not here?
I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.
