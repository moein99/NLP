wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
Oh my God!
Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.
I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
Yeah.
Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to come over>
I.. I.. I need a good lie.
No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
I do not.
Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said.. <pause> He said.. "Joey you stink at lying." What am I going to do?
Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>
Oh.. man..
Yeah.
Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
Pheebs, I still need some help here
Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
I can't believe I won.
Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?
Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
I lie better then that, right?
The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. <whiny voice> And they all got to meet Santa!
Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
Oh.. My sister's raccoon.
Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>
Setting the table.
ooh oooh..
What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
Actually its not pies, its just pie.
Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.
Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler walks back, looking angrily at Joey)
Uhm... (looks down) Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
