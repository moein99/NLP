Thursday? But that�s Halloween.
[It�s just] So spooky, that�s all.
I know, u-uch.
What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
No, they�re comin�, we�re waitin� right here.
Hey.
Maybe we should just eat now.
Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there�s still some food left on their place, okay, what�s the restaurant�s policy about people eatin� that?
But it happens? (waiter leaves) I�m gotta go to the bathroom.
If you ask me to stay, I�ll pee. (leaves)
(returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting now, sits) Finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to Phoebe�s chair) Pheebs, who the hell�uhuhh!
Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! �lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails. (Hope, *I* kept up.)
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it�s ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don�t care.
That�s a great story�can I eat it?
(mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because �
Son of a bitch!
Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)
(returned) No, no, it�s okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
Chandler, control your woman!
(to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you two?
So? Did have sex, right?
See ya. Well, this is just us.
Do, do you gonna do it now?
No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)
Nah, just me. All alone. (all the food is served) Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
Joey! Joey.
That�s the best birthday ever.
