(in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)
(sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)
Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Seriously? She actually said that?
Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Without that, you just got "lame with women".
(sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)
Hey!
(looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)
...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)
Heeeyy! Hey!
Yeah....
Not knowing when to shut up...
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)
Me! I'm up for puppets!
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" nod to Ross)
(kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.
Allright. See you later!
(to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?
What kind?
Wow! You blow my mind...
Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
It's like the cheapest college ever.
