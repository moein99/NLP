Hey.� How come you're answering your own phone?� Where's your crazy assistant?
Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
No, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!
Yeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
Hey!� How come the door's locked?
Hey!� Open the door.� What's going on?� (He knocks.)
What are you . ..� (He sees her in her negligee.)� Why are you dressed like that?
Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
Okay.� (pause.� He looks over her shoulder at the table with the wine.)� Whoa, whoa.� Why are there two glasses of wine out?
Dude, come home!
COME . . .� HOME.
I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin' on ya.� I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
All right look.� (He walks to the hallway.)� If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna.
(outside the apartment door) I just heard him!
(listens at the door.)� No.� (pause) All right, I'm going in.
I heard him again!
Okay.� Great.� I'll see you when you get here.� I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
Absolutely.� You'd do it for me.� Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.
All right.� All right.� Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?� (He checks the bathroom shaking the bat.� Then he proceeds to their bedroom.)� Bwa-ah-ah!
(emerging) Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
(sniffing the air and then Monica.)� Why do I smell men's cologne?
(sniffs his shirt.)� Oh yeah.� I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
I guess not.
Yeah, right Monica.� I'm so sorry.
(spots the suitcase just inside the door where Chandler left it) Whoa, whoa.� Wait a minute.� Wait a minute.� If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
What's going on?
What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife?� Huh?� Do you think I'm like, "Duh."� (He strikes himself in the head with the bat.� He stands dazed for a moment.)
Yeah?� (His eyes bug out.)
(pause) Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't.� But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
All right.
Thanks.� (Joey and Chandler exit to the hall.� Joey pulls out the tickets and hands one to Chandler.)� Here's your ticket.
Thanks man.
Where are you going?
