Suck-fest.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

'Tonight' tonight?
How could you lose him?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Marcel?
Marcel?
A monkey.
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Oh. Then, no.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Marcel?
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
