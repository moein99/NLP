Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
No, no... how come you are working here?
No, no, no!
Im sayin I see a difference.
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
Yeah.
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Nope.
Nope.
Not from where I was standin.
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
She is so hot!
Pheebs?
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Cool, thanks.
Hey.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Yep. Ice Capades.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Okay... Well maybe now Im not okay with it not being okay.
Out.
(Spreading his arms wide) Yes.
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
You meant sex, right?
