C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Instead of...?
Never had that dream.
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Ohh.
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
I say push her down the stairs.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
(comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
What, like there's a rule or something?
Who's Paul?
Hey, Paul!
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
(picking up a leftover part) What's this?
Which goes where?
Done with the bookcase!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
You got screwed.
Shut up!
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man, (looks to Chandler)
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here. (Exits.)
Congratulations.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Morning, Paul.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Yeah, I'm an actor.
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Look, it was a job all right?
I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)
(sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!
(bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
