I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
C'mon, she's your mom!
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Yeah.
Right. No big deal.
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
You don't think my mom's sexy?
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
He forgot to leave his grip size!
So are you gonna tell him?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Me neither, y'know what-
What are you mad at me for?!
(Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?
Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
(To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
(Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
That makes more sense.
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
