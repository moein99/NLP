Hi everyone.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
What's up man?
(to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
We have a winner!
It's never gonna happen.
You and Rachel.
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the room behind them)
Are you going to do it?
Do you want any help?
Good luck, man.
OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
Hey, where are you going?
You can't go out there.
Because of... the reason.
I, um, can't tell you.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
He's planning your birthday party.
(as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
(singing) I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Sorry, that was wax.
(does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
