Probably kill myself!
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
(to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
We love you, man. (Kisses Ross)
So?
What's wrong with the twentieth?
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
C'mon, Ross!
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.)
What?
-Peaches?
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
What?
With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Really?
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
