Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
(sigh)... It's a fertility study.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
We make fire. Cook meat.
Oh, OK.
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Hey!
The country?
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Then you do. Heh, heh.
What do you mean?
Not following you.
(to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.
(pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
The country.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
(panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Sure! Why not?
How do you mean?
Shhhh!
She's still asleep.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I know! Neither did I!
Seven hundred bucks!
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)
