I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
You're in!
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Think it'll work?
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Pathetic mess? I know, butÂ—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
(Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
(at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
(to Lorraine) We can't do that.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Uh, we might be leaving now.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
(in disbelief) Whoa.
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
(to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.
