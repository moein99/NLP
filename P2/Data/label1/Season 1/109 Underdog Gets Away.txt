Hey, hey.
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)
Thanks.
Yeah.
(to Monica) We did?
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
What's wrong?
Oh. What?
Wait, wait, wait!
What Mario isn't telling you...V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are shown with the poster displayed all over New York City.)
So I guess you all saw it.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
The balloon?
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
That tone will not make me go any faster.
That one will.
Nope, not that one.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
You call that delicious?
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Oh, I will.
The bigger half.
