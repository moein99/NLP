That's nice.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
He should take the sack?
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
When's that?
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
(entering quietly) Hey.
Your sister stood me up the other night.
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
Urse...
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
You don't drink.
Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
(Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
I know...
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
Pheebs?
We just got the message.
ï¿½Hola, amigos! (Hey, everybody!)
