Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Thanks! Let's keep going.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
What?
Whoah!
Hey!
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Y'miss it?
That's ridiculous!
Y'okay, Phoebe?
What are you talking about? Keep it!
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Let it go, Ross.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
(shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Alan.
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"?
Do you have any respect for your body?
(dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going on?
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
Okay!
