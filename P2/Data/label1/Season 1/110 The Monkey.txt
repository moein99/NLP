Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Uh, four.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids.
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Hey, kids...
(Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
There y'go, kids.
You seen Sandy?
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
