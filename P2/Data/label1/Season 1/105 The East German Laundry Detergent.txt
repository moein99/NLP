Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
No plans, huh?
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
My god, Angela.
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela.
You look good.
You don't say.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
What?
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
What?
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
(proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Yep.
Which what?
No, but he's...
Oh my god.
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
So, you and Angela, huh?
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
What?
Come on, they're close.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Ow!
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Excellent.
