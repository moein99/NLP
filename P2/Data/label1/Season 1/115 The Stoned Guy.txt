Thank you.
So what're you going to do?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
(aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
(tasting) Mmmm. Good.
It's creamier.
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Uh-oh.
(in disbelief) Vulva?
(sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
....yeah... what else?
(walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Alright, now you say something.
Come on! You like this woman, right?
You want to see her again, right?
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
(turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Say it... say it!
You're not going to believe this!
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again.
What a tool!
(to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?
All right, Ross!
Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
You cuddled.
Yeah, where the hell is he?
