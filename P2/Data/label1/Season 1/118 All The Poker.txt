Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
Shut up!
Thank you.
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)
About what?
Heh... I was bluffing.
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
(pause)...Yeah?
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
What?
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Check.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)
(to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Oh!
(triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
