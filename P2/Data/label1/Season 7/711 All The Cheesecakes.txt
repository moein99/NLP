All right, I should get going, big day a work. Yknow Im in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead.
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, its just not my character thats not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Ill see you at 8:00.
(entering) Hey!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Wow! Im so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? Im sorry. (They hug.) How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! Ill pay for myself!
The RossIs that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goodys sale is over?!
Hey.
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Rosss behalf. I-I think the rule applies here yknow, since she has a chance to get on broad back
Aww thats nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
(entering) Hey!
(seeing what theyre doing) What do you got there?
Huh? Uh (He starts taking off his pants.)
Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why?
What?! Tonight?!
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin here?
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it again. The waiter leaves.) Yknow what Pheebs?
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Yknow-yknow what I really want?
Is to have a long, long talk. Yknow? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Whats the rush? What?
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
No, Im gonna!! Thats right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Well, she graduated from high school!
Fine!
Fine!
(to the waiter) What are you still doin here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
No! No! No Pheebs, Im not gonna yell at you. I just yknow, started thinking about you and David and Iremember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?
Hey, yknow you could always visit him.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
I can give it a shot.
(pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin? (Starts digging in.)
