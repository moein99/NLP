I call it!!
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Well then let me do it!
No-no-no! Look, Ive been thinking about it. Im an actor right? So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
No-no-no-no look no! I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts! Yknow? Everyone knows Im an ass man!
Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. Itll be me! And I swear Ill do a really good job. Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
So I can do it?
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Okay.
Oh! My head! Oh! (Hes sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!
(entering) Hey!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nods her approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
(reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and" And then I cant think of a good word for right here. (He points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)
Yes!
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe Ill talk about London! Yknow when you two hooked up! Only, only I wont say hooked up. Ill say, "Began their beautiful journey"
"by doin it."
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing yknow youre in the bathtub together and shes feeding you strawberries?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Oh.
Yeah baby!
Oh.
Yeah baby!
Hey!
Oh, dude Im so sorry!
Hey no-no-no-no! Its cool! Its cool! I-Ill only be a second, Im still with my brides maid, I justWhere are those condoms you brought?
Ah. (Joey walks to Chandlers bag by getting as far away from Chandlers bed as possible.)
(pause) For just you?
Hey listen, why dont you come downstairs with me? Theres some really nice girls down there.
All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)
Thats what that was?! Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Oh (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadnt left you that last one? You two mightve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! Its like it was in the stars!
Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv(Shuts up on Monicas glare.)
Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now Im a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
What?! Thats not fair! Its not my fault! I was off with my brides maid! And whos to say I wouldve even said yes?! (To Monica) I mean I wouldve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
This is crazy.
Hey.
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
No-hey-no! If you dont want me to do it, I except that. I dont care about that. I justI dont want you to be upset.
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! Youre so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, cause you guys are perfect for each other. Yknow, we look at you and-and we see you together and it justit-it fits. Yknow? And you just know its gonna last forever.
What?
Really? I can do it?
Hey! (They hug.)
Well I dont know remember exactly but, its-its pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Hey!
So are guys doing okay?
Whats my little chef got for me tonight?
Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. (They kiss.) Okay.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! (Groans and picks up a piece of food.) How you doin?
Here you go.
Good for you!
