Hey!
Who wants French toast?
Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
(sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.) Yknow, something a little snugglyer?
Well, the duck
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
(sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, Im gonna get cranky!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
All right, Im gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)
I dont know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream? (Hes about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachels room. He walks into her room and feels the bed.) Thats so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.) Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.) (In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar(Stops reading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) wouldnt be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! (Continues to read.)
Sweepin. Why? Turn you on?
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Where are you going? The vicar wont be home for hours.
Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?
Yeah I did!
Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn!
You got porn!
Hey Rach.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
No-no-no, Im serious. You dont smell it? Somethings on fire.
Oh, yknow what? Its probably just your burnin loins.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Gotcha.
Hello, Zelda.
The vicar!
Like a goalie, right?
All right, Im sorry. Rach IRach Im sorry. Okay? Im sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)
Huh?
(nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)
This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)
Hey-hey, youre startin to sound like the butchers wife there in-in chapter seven.
I dont want to, Im scared.
