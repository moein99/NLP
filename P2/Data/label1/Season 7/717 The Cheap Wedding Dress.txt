Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)
This is impossible Monica, why dont you just pick all 15? (Hands back the paper.)
Oh yeah, I added three.
Oh yeah (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter, scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)
(checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin in or movin out?
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Boyfriend?
Im Joey. (They shake hands.)
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?
Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh.
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go? (The lamp hes holding.)
Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, Ill grab this one. (He follows her upstairs.)
(entering) Hey Chandler!
Listen, sorry I didnt stop by last night but I had a date.
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Yeah!
Two days ago.
Oh yeah?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, Im dating this girl whos also seeing another guy. But, I dont know, Im not to worried about it.
Kristen Lang.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
(not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or Im the one who dates her.
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
Yeah well we should order some food then.
(smiling) That sounds fair.
Ah yeahwait a second now! Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.
Yeah. Uh, (thinks)a slice(Thinks)six dollars?
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
(entering) Hey!
I just wanted to come by and yknow, wish you good luck on your date.
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Wow, thats in like 20 minutes. Youd better get dressed.
Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Okay dude! (Finds a receit.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!
I dont know.
Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
Well well see!
Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So just a light layer?
(entering) Kristen?
Hi!
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically Im not breaking any rules so I
Hi!
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)
A woman in a mans body.
So yknow Ross its funny cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
So youve just married the one time then?
(laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well nowwhy did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
No. No.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Monkey lover!
When do you think we lost her?
Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Yknow, she could use a little(Whistles that she needs to do what theyre doing.) (Something happens on the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)
