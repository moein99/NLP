No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! (They all exit.)
(entering) Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didnt get the part?
No!
No!
Nooo!
Yes!!
Yes thats the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Oh no, Ill be done by then.
I know! All right, Ill see you guys over there! Im off to fight the Nazis.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? (Rachel pauses as she thinks.)
Yeah! Me too. (He pats his pocket.)
Im doing my scenes with you?
Wow! I cant believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
I think you did.
UhCookie?
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
(wiping his face) What?!
(wipes face) So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
(glances at Richard) No. Nope, I uhI thI thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Yknow? Hes uh, hes a face toucher. (Behind his back, Richard is nodding no.)
Hey! Where have you been?
Oh.
Yeah.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I wont get spit in the eyes, yknow?
Great! All right. Ill see you later. (He starts to leave.)
Uh, I think hes in Rachels room. See ya. (Exits.)
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
All right.
Picture? What picture?
Okay uh, look I know youre a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff
But youre spittin all over me man!
You know youve been spitting on me?!
(wiping face) Wow! Didnt know that.
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! (Reading from the script) Picture? What picture? (He pauses then spits) Eh?
What picture?!
You went through my personal property?
(pause) Because Vincent, we were lovers. (Pause) For two years!
Great scene yeah?
Thanks a lot.
Oh, Im-Im not working tomorrow.
No! No! I cant! You gotta get me out of it! Ive got plans! (Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.)
Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasnt supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. Its my best friends, and Im officiating so I really cant work past four.
Im having surgery!
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didnt want you to worry about me. But, Im having surgery today.
Transplant.
Hair transplant.
Its not on my head.
Hey! Youre here! Great! Great! Great! Lets get going buddy, weve got a scene to shoot!
Are you drunk?
Yes you are!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And Im the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Thank you. Thank you.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
(on phone) Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Damnit!
Im still on the set!
I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.
No! No, Im the minister! All right, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.
Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered!
So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done for the day.
Yeah! Youyou were wonderful.
So I got your car, its right outside.
Thats what you told me.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! (Joey picks him up in a firemans carry and carries him out.) Here we go.
(entering) Thats my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, Im sorry Im a little late. You may be confused by this now, (Hes still in costume) but you wont be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, lets get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. Ive known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as Ive left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Chandler?
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Yeah you do!
Aw crap! Okayuhuh lets-lets do the rings.
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To Chandler) Now kiss her again.
