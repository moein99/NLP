Shhhh!
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Fifty-six!
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
(gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
What the hell is in there?
Yeah that dog left!
(interrupting him) Don't do it!
Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likinÂ’ ice cream.
Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
(through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
(realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)
(entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Ross, you need some help?
(sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
You think?
