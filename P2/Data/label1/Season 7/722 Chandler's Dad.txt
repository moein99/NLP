(entering) Hey!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Hey!
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
So uh, whats your name?
Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Me too! Theres a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Pheebs!
Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear!
Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, thats weird!
Thats weird!
Thatskinda hot.
Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.
Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Youve seen my huge stack of porn right? (Phoebe nods.)
Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that hes got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!
Yknow, Im beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
The silk? Feels really good!
Yeah! And-and things arent assmashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with mens underwear!
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! Youve got cotton, silk, lace! And yknow what Ive always wondered about?
Pantyhose! Yknow? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here (He mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.) I should go take these off shouldnt I?
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and goes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!
Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on Days of Our Lives.
Yeah.
Hm-mmm.
Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you.
