Morning!
Pretty good.
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; Im late for work.
YeahHey, dont worry, shes a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that Im not looking for a serious relationship; thatd be great.
Just casually slip it in, yknow lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, Im a lonerNo! An outlaw! Tell her she doesnt want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Hey, Im gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! Hed even make the girl pancakes! Plus, hed make extras and leave em for me.
Fine! (Pause) Now, whered we land on those pancakes? (She chases him out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)
Hi!
Sorry about that, but I couldnt get that lock to work on the door.
You must be Rachel, Im Erin.
Hey! Whats up?
Hey-hey, whos your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey, startling him) Hey!!
Erin! Still here!
Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.
Yeah. Ill uh, Ill call ya.
(to Erin) Okay, good to see you again.
Bye-bye.
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
What?!!
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Man, do you know what guys want!
My beers?! Look you guys, shes a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I justI dont see it going anywhere.
Look Im sorry you guys, I-I just dont think so.
Hey, dont start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? Youre the one whos in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, youre the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.
Hey!
Erin.
(skeptical) What party?
Whos birthday party?
(still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?
(still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.
Hey.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Yknow? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well thats a
Okay.
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
What about Game 1 of the Series?
You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin) Ill be right back.
(returning) Hey! You wanna go?
Okay. See you guys later.
(whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)
Hey!
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still And guess what, Im thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
No-no-no-no-no! Its a surprise, but its gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Where are you gettin this?
Oh. Oh.
No hey Rach, its cool okay? Yknow Im a loner too! (Heads for his room.) Right?
No! No. Dont do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Yeah?
(coming back out) Finally!
