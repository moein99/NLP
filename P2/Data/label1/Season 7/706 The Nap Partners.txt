Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Die Hard 2.
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
And?
Die Hard!!!!!!
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Well, I dont know!!
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go.
Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later.
No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Rosss hand.) Bye.
Hey! Whats going on?
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how youd handle maid of honor type situations.
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if Im the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Hi.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Okay! When?!
Uh-huh!
I want to do it again.
Why not?
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)
Okay, all right, this is how its going to work. Were gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?
(crying) I dont want to marry Chandler!
Ive got cold feet.
No, one man for the rest of my life? I dont know if I can do it! This means Ill never get to sleep with Joey!
(out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Okay, Phoebe
Were now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Oh! Thats nice.
Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.
Yeah.
And shes back in the game.
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for RachelDamnit!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)
No reason, Im just saying that uh Thats where Ill be.
Great nap.
(reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.)
