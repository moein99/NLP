Hey.
What are you doing?
(laughs) Why would you want to do that?
Rach, there is a decent place to
No. No. No.
No. Rosita does not move.
As in Rosita does not move.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and its at the perfect angle so you dont get any glare coming of off Stevie.
(glaring at her) Is there a problem?
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said dont, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
(slowly turning and glaring at her) Shes not even cold yet!
Thats true.
Yeah, I (Shuts off the TV.) I dont want Stevie to see her like this.
No I wont.
Because, I know what I like and what I dont like! Its not the same thing!
I dont know why you say that so soon.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Well, I guess youre right. Maybe, maybe Ill take her down to the incinerator. Its gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back, but it doesnt come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.) Shes heeled!
No its not weird, its a miracle!
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
(interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?
Miracle!
Someone like anangel?
(angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads for her room.)
Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)
Fine.
No. Really?
(quietly) My chair heels itself.
Well, it looks like it wasnt heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)
Your chair?!
So, there was no miracle?!
(sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. Im so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
How do you figure?
Thats right!
Yeah! We are!
Oh yeah.
Ahhh (To Rachel) Eh?
Hey!
