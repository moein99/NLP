Im sorry, do I know you?
Nothing, Im just practicing blowing you off because Im gonna be a big movie star!
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Oh, its this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. Its really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Yeah, theres this guy from Chicago whos supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guys right after him. (Joeys cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!
(to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!
(on phone) Oh my God!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
I know! My grandmothers gonna see this!
I dont know! Its not like its porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Yknow? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back.
Well thats true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. Its really sweet and-and tender.
Hey, Im back!
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Oh great! Yknow I wouldve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Yknow, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! (Starts to leave.)
And scene! Huh? Wasnt that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Wow! Sure! Thats great!
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
SoWhat?
Yes!
No. What?
Barmifsaed?
Nope.
Yep.
Thats right.
I dont know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
I just have to call my agent and tell her I cant do the part. (Gets up for the phone.)
Unless what?
Like what?
Wow! This looks great!
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Thank God!
Ah.
Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Ow!
Yeah.
The fruit roll up.
Delicious.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
The Silly Putty! Its not so silly anymore!
And whats cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
My whole familys from Naples!
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I totally understand. You need to yknow make sure I dont have any horrible scars or tattoos. Dont you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands back up and looks down.) So there you go, thats me. (We cut to a camera angle looking at the casting director and movie director through Joeys legs.) One hundred percent natural! (Suddenly, theres a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.
