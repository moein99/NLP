(grabbing the candy bar) Yeah Ill take that.
Yeah, shes been out there for twenty minutes, Im surprised you didnt hear her on the way over.
But I-I-I cant stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. Im supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?
You guys dont think I look 19?
(To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
I was afraid of that.
Sup? Sup dude?
So youre playing a little Playstation, huh? Thats whack! Playstation is whack! Sup with the whack Playstation, sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Come on man, really how old?!
Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)
Yeah!
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Dont worry about that man, that happens.
Yeah! Once.
I did it anyway.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
What?
You guys kissed! Oh mythis is huge!
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Really?
Seriously?
(gasps) Im 30!
(realizes) Aww crap!
Psss, that is whack!
Yeah! Well, I think well see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you dont."
Wouldnt she?
Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You ate my candy bar!
They break your heart, dont they?
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
What?! Whats wrong with my eyes.
And thatll get rid of my wisdom?
