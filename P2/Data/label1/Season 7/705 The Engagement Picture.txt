Uhh, well Ive got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. (Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got an extra one?
Great. (He doesnt like it.) You got anything thats not Ralph Lauren?
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Nothing, why?
Huh, Rach I got to say its gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Really? Cause I could kinda use the money.
Yeah, okay.
Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) OohHey, donuts!
Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all over himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)
See? Thats a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) Youre changing it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Okay, firstfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and smiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), youre looking down, keep looking down
I had a donut. (Chandler nods.)
Hey!
Yeah! That guys all right!
What?
Hey well, you cant teach someone to be good with women. Yknow, thats why I never had any luck with Chandler.
Hey! No-no-no-no, you cant take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
(shocked) What?!
I know, Monica told me.
I dont know Rach.
One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
I dont know. You uh, you got something for me?
Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as to many women.
Yeah, for you!
Yeah, we look great together.
Yknow, we dont have to imagine.
Well just see.
