(entering, excited) Hey!
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, youre not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
And-and-and not only that, Im gettin a new brain!!
Oh well, theyre killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
(seriously) Yes, its a highly controversial procedure.
Well, I think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months.
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Nice.
Oh, tell me about it. And shes been on the show forever, its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Yes, but in Drake Remorays body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Say what?
No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
(quickly) I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Umm
Okay.
Ms. Monroe (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received.)
So you like the nachos uh? Myself Im partial to
See you in 2003. (She walks away.)
Im so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
No I mean it! I cant believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Joey.
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, Im really nervous about-about being you. Yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Yknow? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Oh thats great! Oh thank you so much!
Hey! Now, Ive been watching some tapes, hows this? (In a British accent.) "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Yeah.
(shocked) I can do an English accent?! That babys going on my resume!
Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed) All right!
Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
Oh wellHey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Yknow? Itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. Youre so talented.
Hey thats not true! Look at uh, look at Angela LansbAngelina Jolie!
Like-like what?
(impressed) Wow!
Oh hey come on, dont-dont-dont do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, Im thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" (Shes not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We should probably get-get uh
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that cause shes so passionate?
Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Hey!
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
(shrugs) Sure. Yep.
Okay, bye-bye.
All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I
(notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!
They sent me todays script! They never send the script!
Well no, Im just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes what that means.) Oh
(flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Yeah well, Im guessing after this shes not going to be crazy about electricity either.
(as Jessica) I dont think so.
Oh noo
Thanks!
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
The airport?
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Thats a really long time.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. (Realizes.) And I just got what you meant againThat isI tell ya, that is a tricky one!
Good luck.
