Hey.
I do. Theres uh, lets see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids Ive Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Yeah?
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
(about to cry) Those two only had each other!
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin it by the park.
Hey Pheebs?
Hey Rach?
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? (He shows her what hes been drawing.)
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
(watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Yeah, thats her.
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Whats up buddy?
Waiting for candy.
(stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
Thats right, its all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to the candy and starts eating it.)
(with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I dont know (Grabs the note.)
