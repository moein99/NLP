Probably Monica and Chandler.
Hey guys! Look whos back! Its Ray-ray!
(excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!
(excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who youwhat?!!
What?!
(entering) Hello!
Hey Rach. (Stares at her.)
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
What theyre not invited?! Oh no, thats terrible! Theyre gonna be crushed!
(looking around) You got me. I dont
Well, Im sorry. I thought parents were coming! Yknow? Your parents are comin! Chandlers parents are comin! Rosss parents are comin!
Well-wellsee? Parents are comin!
(leaning down to her) Maybe youll order a little sangria?
We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)
Nice move.
Hey!
No, Im performing the ceremony. Im not wearing a tux.
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
I dont think so.
(excitedly) Can I come?! I wont even talk! Youll just hear the noise from my video camera.
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Okay
Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!
Why are you taking this away from me?
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Hey.
Yeah, theyre not coming.
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. Theyfeel a little unwanted.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom
Come on! Look just-just telllet her know that you really want them to be there. Lets not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Is it her fault that some of them didnt make it to you?
I dont know. Just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with the invitations, orNo-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I dont think you can blame it on them so (He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)
(entering) Hey.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, its gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is its the same day as my nieces christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. Cause my parts just in the beginning Im not even in the rest of the showWedding!
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little til they get there?
Yeah! Yeah yknow, like warm up the crowd. Ask em where theyre from. Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. Im a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one greater!
(entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. Theyre so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.
