(laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?
(on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what theyre gonna say.)
(hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It wasnt that good.
(entering from bathrooms excitedly) You guys! You guys! Youre not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Im gonna be on two TV shows!
Oh, you werent finished?
Uh Rach, if youre gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
(groans in disgust) Wow, its really long.
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Ill be playing Drake Remorays twin brother, Stryker!
(jumps up) WellI got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
Hey Terry!
Its been a while, huh? Wow, its funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Okay.
(looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Strykers twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Yknow Terry, I-I dont really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.
Well. I guess you think youre pretty special huh? Sittin up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well yknow what? (Throws the script away) This is one star whos hoop This is a star that the hoopthis hoopI was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Hey.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To Phoebe and Rachel) Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next weeks script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like theyre taking it off the air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) Were not even shootin them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin!
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Because they wanted me to audition!
Hey! Terry.
Wait! Terry! WaitLookWait I-I Look, Im really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking Im too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
(jumping up and removing the bandages) Im back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
