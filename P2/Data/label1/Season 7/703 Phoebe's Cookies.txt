What?
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandlers eyes!
Feminine.
(entering) Ahoy!
Great! Im finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Oh, its great! Its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)
You could?
(drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there. (Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)
All right.
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Lets start sailing, and I want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them) Yo-ho-ho!
Uh, boat rope.
Uhh, rub it?
Id say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh
And deaf!
Yes.
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
(entering) Hey.
I dont want to talk about it. Yknow, you couldve at least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs whats left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)
(recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)
(entering) Hey.
Oh uh, I dont know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Because! Youre mean on the boat!
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Well it hit me anyway! And it wouldve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
You wont boss me around anymore?
And youll be nice?
And youll be topless?
Do you want me to learn?!
Ohh yeah.
Nope.
I dont know why you just dont say left.
Huh?
(hurrying over) Okay! Okay, youre yelling again! See that?
Oh, yknow what? Since Im here, I think Im gonna have me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didnt know there.
Oh, yknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
All right thats it! Youre yelling and I dont see you taking your top off! I quit!
Why not?!
Greens? Im a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Yes! Yes! You did and youre still yelling at me!
Well, hey I did learn.
Yeah! Come on.
Yeah, its okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. Its the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Damnit!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why dont you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)
Just pull on it.
What else?
Thank you.
What are you doing?
What youdont hold it like that! Youre lettin all the good stuff fall out.
Careful! Youre wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! Im my dad!
