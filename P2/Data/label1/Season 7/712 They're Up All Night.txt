(looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Yknow what else makes you wonder?
Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.)
Then why are you wearing Monicas jacket?
(whispering) Ross!
Come here, check this out!
No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down to get a closer look.)
(standing up) Yknow, theres two women dude.
Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
(annoyed) I dont know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.) (Pause) Yeah, I do.
What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
(covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the door.)
Come on!
All right well, yknowI guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it out.)
All right, it wont go down any further. Its stuck.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
(looks at the ground and at Ross) I dont know Ross! I-I tell you what, lets flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
No.
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! Im not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I cant go if I break my leg.
Well all right so, it looks like were even!
Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Yeah? Really? No ones home?
Yeah!
All right! Just hurry up!
I think face to face.
Face to face, yeah!
All right.
(grunting) Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?!
Yknow, when we talked about face to face, I dont think we thought it all the way through.
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Hi.
(angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Its not that far! Just drop!
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin to come down and Im not wearing any underwear!
