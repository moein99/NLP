All right, uh (To Ross) Oh hey, youve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica
"when I look back over our time together"
Well, I cant do everything! Look back over your time together.
(yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! Were dying out here!
Hey!
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
(shocked) Has it been that long?!
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Okay.
I know! I mean its not like we werent cool about it.
(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
How?! When?!
IN LONDON!!!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Well I didn't tell them!
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
No.
They know you know.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Ooh!
I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
It's not my first time.
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
I dont want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Im sorry, I justI like things the way they are.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Hey.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If thats what you really want.
Hey!
(To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! Thats good!
What? I dont get it.
(starting to cry) I have never known love like this.
If he goes first he can!
