They do!
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
(screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! (He buries his head in Phoebes lap for comfort.)
(screaming) And now Chandler! Were all gettin so old! (Looking up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)
Yeah, youre roommate is a soap opera star.
Hey, whats the horsepower on this thing?
But it hurts my Joeys Apple.
Well actually
Dude, you soooo need this car.
Yep. (Starts for Monicas room, but Chandler stops him.)
Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?
Will you quit hoggin it!
(to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Yeah!!
Oh, I dont know Pheebs. Itll be okay.
Thats not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!
Like what?
Hey, yknow what you guys? I think Im gonna go walk her home. (Gets up and runs out.)
Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe thats one thing you can cross off your list.
Oh, and plus Im 1/16th Portuguese.
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)
Yes!
(entering, limping, and holding his arm) I dont like this anymore. (He sits down with them in pain.)
(crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in Rosss shoulder.)
All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Lets go!
No.
