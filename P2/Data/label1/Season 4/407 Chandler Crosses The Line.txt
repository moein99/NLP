Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
You got all that from the back of her head?
Whos Elaine?
(on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, its me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that Ill be there as soon as I can.
Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to(he stops talking suddenly)
Yeah?
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more(his time runs out for real)
(on phone) Hey dude, its me.
Listen uh, Im really sorry, it looks like Im gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasnt there!
Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.)
(rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Why?
Well, youre amazing.
(very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.
No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool.
No-no, Kathy.
No. No, Kathy.
Yknow what I think? I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Whats up?
You do?
Well, youre timing couldnt be better. Shes not my girlfriend anymore.
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, thats why I let people watch.
Well, Ive been better. But, Im all right. So you like her huh?
No-no-no, no its uh, its okay.
Yeah. You know why? Cause you came to me first.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy. So
Who?
What?
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
What?!! Thats even worse!!
I dont know! But its the same!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like "Well, kinda.") Well, yknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that Im not gonna eat! You know why?!
Because its all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And Im not happy about you either. (The bread maker dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)
