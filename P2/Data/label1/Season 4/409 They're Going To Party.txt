I think I know that girl.
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
No, I had sex in high school.
Will you calm down, hes just a human guy.
Really?!
All right, Ill see you guys.
I have an audition, but Ill definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought youd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
So youve been sittin around here all mornin?
So what if he didnt come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Well, we could do that!
Well do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Yeah!
Yeah!!
Yeah! All right? Lets go!
Yeah!!!
All right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and well head back out.
So, were having fun, right?
We dont need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, well head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
Are you serious?!
Thank God! Im exhausted!
Yeah, but uh, I dont want to be up too late, so uh, Ill have a decaf.
I cant hear a word youre saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Were 29, were not women.
