Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Mornings here! Morning is here
See, this is a great apartment.
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
You have Knicks tickets?
(examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Yeah!
Youre not stupid. Youre meaner than I thought.
Yeah, you do!
Come on!
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Oh comelook, when I was a kid my dads company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasnt in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Hey!
We dont make enough fun of you already?
Oh-no, dont try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
What?
All right look, Ross, hes right. Emilys great, shes great! But this way too soon, youre only gonna scare her!
No! You dont want to wreck it, you dont want to go to fast!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, lets trade! The timings perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Yes! Didnt you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didnt read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Its the Knicks!
Whoa!
Huh.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Done!
Oh.
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Ooh, I like that.
Come on man, you know Id do it for you! Because, youre my best friend.
All right!
Okay!
Whats the game?! Whats the game?!
Uhh, theyre tall.
Oh.
Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I cant.
Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Okay.
Uh-huh, not as high as(picks a card) It worked! King!
Why?!
Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Yknow, kinda like a peace offering.
Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!
I dont know.
I dont want to move again!
That was one good minute!
Good night.
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Yeah! Yeah!
Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at him.)
Hey! (Singing) Get into gear!
(happily) Okay!
