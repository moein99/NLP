Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
All right thats it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the door.)
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, youre gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
I have actually not heard of that.
Why dont you tell me something I dont know! (He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an Oops! have.)
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that hed better come up here and apologize. Ill see you later. (Starts to leave)
He said that he wasnt gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what hes gonna do is have you evictedIll see you later.
Well he made Rachel cry!
All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns around) I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)
Please dont kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasnt there fault, it was mine.
No you cant do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. Im the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, Ill do whatever you want.
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
What, what is it?
Thats not, prison lingo, is it?
Yeah, theres this superintendents dance, the Super Ball. I dont know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that hes a crush on.
Well, hes too shy, he doesnt thing hes good enough to dance with girls yet.
Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when Im doing something exciting and I dont wanna get too excited, I just ahh, yknow try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
No-no, thank you.
All right, Im here, lets ahh, get this over with.
Whoa-whoa, dont we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
No, its okay, but if Im Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Come on man, youre not a potato.
Come on Treeger, dont say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again. Come on. (they start dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a(Treeger throws him) We-he!! Hey!
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a little dance step on the way.)
What?
No I didnt.
No, Im not! And it wasnt a hop it was a pademarie.
All right, well maybe Im enjoying it a little bit. I mean Im getting pretty good at it.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isnt some kind of like girly dance. All right, its like a sport, its manly!
All right.
I dont know how to lead.
What?!
(To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Look, you wanna use our place?
We did it!!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Oh well, okay, good luck.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Okay.
Go get em Treeger.
(intrigued) Really?
No, Im good.
