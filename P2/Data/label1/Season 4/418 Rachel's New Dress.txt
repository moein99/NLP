Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Hey!
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joeys your pal. Joeys your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, theyre hanging out with Joey."
Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!
Hey!
No, but Im gonna!
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Someone you didnt make up!
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
All right look man, I didnt want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! Its not even a name; its barely even a word. Okay? Its kinda like chandelier, but its not! All right? Its a stupid, stupid non-name!
Im sorry man, I didntIm-Im sorry. Im sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.)
So I guess its Joey then!
(answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings them inside.)
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Its not that bad.
So, youre just Bing?
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
See you later, Gene.
Whats up with Gene?
Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby Chandler.)
