(entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (Hes wearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
No, not really. They give you all the information, its uh, its like memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Youre really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Huh.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a fossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display cases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave Hi to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. (Ross does the old "Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your mouth trick.") Okay, moving right along. Come on.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. Im-Im saving this for my friend Ross.
Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname.
Well, how-how come?
Thats crazy.
I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you. Anyway, look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he will sit in it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Whatever.
Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal. Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it. Yknow, hey I understand. Yknow? Hey, when Im in a play and youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right? So its yknow, its uh, its cool. Ill see you tomorrow. (Leaves)
(standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table and they shake hands.)
(stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
