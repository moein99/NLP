Yeah?
Is it the shampoo? Its guava.
Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?
Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe its a pickle?!
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Hey thats what all my relationships are like.
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Yeah, what going on?
Awwww!
Surprise!!
What-what-what is so funny?
Now thats a thinker.
A little salami.
Pastrami.
Yeah. (He goes over to her.)
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
There was a seen in Footloose...
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl
What? Were you like in the movie, or Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)
If you didnt want to play, why did you come to the party?
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
All right look, yknow how-yknow how when youre dating someone and you dont want to cheat on them, unless its with someone really hot?
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If youre going to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!
Feel better now?
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Well, suppose until the babys born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-youd just be eating my animals.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. Theres no meat in beer, right?
Are you all right?
Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)
(trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.
Oooh, what you got there?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Yknow what goes good with that?
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but thats much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
(He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
