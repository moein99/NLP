Hey!
Why?
You can pee here!
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Oh, I know...
(entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Why not?
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
(whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Yeah.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
What kind of smell?
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
You wanna see her again, right?
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Yeah.
Yeah!
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!
(entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Our place, the hall! I...
(Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a safe?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves, comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Hey!
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Hey!
You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed?
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. Then goes inside).
(opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
