(answering phone) Hello.
(answering phone) Hello.
(answering phone) Stop callin!!
All right!
Hey!
Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
No! Im putting that in my room.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Five years.
Hey! Dont do the crime if you cant do the time.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I dont know why youre pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, theres a spot open.
Yeah!
What?
All right. But if you werent my best friend.
(entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
(Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)
My folks.
I dont know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Yeah, yknow at first I thought we could talk about this yknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I dont think I
Look, its not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend. So, Ill see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)
Yeah! You did! And thats why Im leaving.
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around!
Weve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)
(coming out of the bathroom) Whats twisted?
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Hes fine!
Chandler?
Hey!
Hes doin some thinkin!
You kissed my girlfriend!
That doesnt sound like thinking to me!
Yknow I dont think you should be talking at all in there! I think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (Theres no response from Chandler.) Okay.
Ill get it. (Its Kathy.)
Hey.
Thats okay. Chandlers the one Im mad at.
In the box.
(starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!
Yeah, were gonna be fine! Get out!
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin in there.
Now go! Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from youre secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)
All right, who got Chandler? Cause I uh, need to trade.
Uhh, thats not them. Im gonna go call the police.
