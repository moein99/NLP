Hey!
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
Hey.
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
(entering) Hey!
Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
It's 4:30.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Is she great or what?
(to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Well then, do it better!
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
(opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
