(coming in from his bedroom) What is that?
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I mustve hit something on the remote.
No, we didnt even pay our cable billmaybe this is how they punish us.
Maybe we shouldnt pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he just said.)
(to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)
(stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look behind them)
Hey.
Pheebs! Youre blocking the porn! Look out!
Yeah right.
Yeah, he likes porn.
Hey!
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
You play hard to get.
Then you go to Tokyo.
Way to be strong, man!
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. Cause you already told her you love her and she didnt say it back, then she called you and told you that theres another guy, so yeah, go to London thatll scare her!
Ross! Ross! If youre going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)
(pause) Nothing. No, nothing.
Hey.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Noo! Nothing!
I think youre right.
One.
Thats kinda nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah!!
