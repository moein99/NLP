Hey!
Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)
Well, I know what Im giving you for Christmas.
Ohhh!
Hey, Mon! Im not doing anything, why dont you fire me?
Good enough to get fired.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Yes!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Sure! Where are the seats?
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Oh, what are you gonna do? Youre gonna fire me?
(entering) Hey!
(checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)
(entering from the dining room) Hey.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chefs jacket? (sees theres a burn spot on it)
You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)
Its still a tiny bit on fire there.
Yeah. Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey. Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
(opening an envelope) Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
No maam.
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! Its been a long time since I had (tries to do the math in his head, but cant) 327 + 238 dollars!"
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You dont fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and theyll start listening to all the nice things Ive been saying about you.
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
(interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Yknow that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
You bet I do! I just ah, wasnt listening then, thats all.
What are you gonna do? Youre gonna fire me?
Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Yep! Looks like its gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
(leaving) Lean-lean-lean!
