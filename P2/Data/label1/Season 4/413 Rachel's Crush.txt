(entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)
(Holding a turkey leg) Theres gravy?
I think I left a donut up here.
Hey!
(to Ross) That-that is a good trick.
Chandler, look theyre actors. Theyre there to do a job, just cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. I mean just cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Noooo!!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Yep! Grab a plate.
No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin closer.
Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Oh yeah, whos playing?
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
I dont know, it smells good.
(Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!
Come here.
Oh, yeah, totally! Thats such a turn-on!
Oh-ooh, thats the turn-on.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?"
(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin?
Well, you gotta give him something that he cant say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, youre guaranteed hell say yes!
Absolutely! And if it doesnt, can I get the extra ticket?
What the heck is that?
No! Forget her, man! You dont need her, you dont need that!
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! Theres a lot of theories that didnt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Whats ready?
I dont know, it looks the same.
Oh yeah!
Howd it go?
