Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the hall)
(Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Just pickle.
Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Uhhhh. (Hes not sure)
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
He cut off his ear.
Im out.
Wow! Thats pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
In the woods. No wait-wait, thats the joke answer.
Spocks birth control.
Wow! Theres a lot I didnt know about vomit. (The duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck goes back into the bathroom.)
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? Im home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess theres a few things you dont get from book learnin.
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets) Okay? Ive got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be Chandlers pants.
Oh, I-I think Im gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
Hey!
Wh-whats going on?
No he doesnt!
Well, its good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
