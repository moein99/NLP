Its all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls apartment.)
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You dont want to lose that.
Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)
Woo-hoo!!
London baby!
(louder) London baby!!
Bye, Pheebs!
London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)
Come on! Do something!
Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map of London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)
Its London, baby! All right, the hotels here. (Points to the map.) Wait. No, we wanna go No. I know. (Sets the map down.) Im gonna have to go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)
I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.
Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen. Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
Really? To what?
Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the Abbey.)
Hey!
Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the front of it.) Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)
Oh, I embarrass you?
Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Thanks.
Hey.
Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!
Me too.
Noo!! Ive had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!
Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)
(on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
(on tape) Oh, Chandler.
Thats Fergie baby!!
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, Im in my map and-and(Ross enters) Hey!
Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)
Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didnt think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
(on phone) Hey, Pheebs! Its Joey!
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Kinda, but Ive just been having way too much fun.
No, I dont think so.
Whos seven?
Ahh, the babies miss me?
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Two pizzas?!
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
Whats in it?
(Looking up at the waiter)Thats not food...No, I dont, no...(Taps Chandler on the shoulder.) Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I cant even remember what Phoebe looks like.
(Pointing at Chandler.) Your different here too. Your mean in England. (Chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each other.)
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now Im not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) But not as much as I love America. (Looking at Chandler.) Could we please..go home now?
(Putting his arm around her.) Im not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Hello?
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Ahh Pheebs, you know youre still my number one girl.
Ohh great!!!
(Confused.) But, he loves Emily?
Okay.
Hold on. Hold on. (Picking up a note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.) Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Right!
Hey.
Have you seen Monica?
(With a confused look on his face.) What?
Look weve got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachels coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
I know! Thats why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
(Whispering.) Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. Ill cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
Okay. (They both walk off to watch for Rachel.)
Hey, Felicity.
Yeah.
(In a New York accent.) Fuggetaboutit. (She giggles.) How you doin?
Oh, yeah.
(Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to escort her down the aisle.)
No, but its okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
No.
Ah, Im-Im walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham takes her place.) Im about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. (Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her "Hey." And now Im at the front with Ross. Its Phoebe. (He shows Ross the phone.) He looks pretty mad. Uh...Id better go.
