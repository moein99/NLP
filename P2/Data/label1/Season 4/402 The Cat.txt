How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Look, were not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
All right. But, youre gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)
Looks good, uh?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Oh. What do you do?
What? Whats wrong?
(to Chandler) Dude, Phoebes mom has got a huge peni...
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I dont think any of them are gonna work out.
Pretty nice?
(to Peter) Good for you!!
(looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
(pause) Hows that going?
Thats so sweet. (pause) Im gonna get some coffee. (gets up and leaves)
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya!
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
(still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!!
Yeah...
(getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt think big enough to fit a grown man!
I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what Im gonna do?
(looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Thats a good call. Right.
Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!!
