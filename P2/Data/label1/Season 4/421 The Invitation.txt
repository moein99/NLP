I know. Ross is getting married.
Everybodys doing stuff!
(snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Yeah!
Hey!
Were gonna climb Mt. Everest!
We could get that Everest video though.
And while were down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! (Chandlers excited.) Oh, yknow what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah we are!
It's never gonna happen.
[singing] I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Dont answer that.
Awful! Horrible!
She was nothing compared to you.
Ewwwww!
(taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! Youre at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Hey!
Dont worry man, I get to bring a guest. Well show him.
I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didnt know that, but you should see your faces.
Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Ohhh.
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
