(joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
(proudly) Oh, you should here me.
Look, I told ya, Im not going to any clinic! I dont have a problem, youre the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, youve just had your first class!
Ohhh, yeah!
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Thats not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
You cant do anything!
This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!
Yeah, well
Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well.
I am (Looks in his date book.) free!
What?!
(still looking in date book) Hey! Thats the day after I stop menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isnt mine.
Joey Tribbiani.
(sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you doin?
What?!
(asleep) So why dont you give me your number?
(muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! Whats happening?
(muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and its gonna help me not to snore.
(takes out the mouth guard) I know I dont have too! It tastes good. (Puts it back in.)
(muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to say, "Whats up with that?")
