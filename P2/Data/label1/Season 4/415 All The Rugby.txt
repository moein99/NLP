Ohh, Nothing.
I know what it did! Nothing.
Like this. (Shrugs)
Sure! It flushes it.
Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)
And there it is.
So what are you doing bringing her here?! Theres people here!
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around and then back at Joey.) Im tellin ya!
Hey! Whats up?
(to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Dude, youre not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Hey-hey, whats going on?
Thanks for telling me!
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I cant believe you said youd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
(pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. Thats called a scrum, okay? Its kinda like a huddle.
Ross! (Laughs) Theyre gonna kill you!
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! Its not like hesChandler!
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy (Points). And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!
Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
I totally dont know what youre talking about.
No.
Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
The Red Ross! Okay.
Yeah, sure.
Uhh, look, your eyes still popping out a little, Im gonna go get some ice.
