Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Me too! Me too! Me too! (Yeah, he does the same thing.)
Yeah, I got too excited!
(entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Oh umm, not go.
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Great! Problem solved!
Well, back to square one.
(quickly) Yes!
Peanut butter!
A swimmer!
Monica. Oh huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
Ascot!
North route!
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Hey man, what's up?
Sure, what do you want to see?
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
What do you like better action or comedy?
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Hey! You ready to go?
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Hey!
You got it!
Bye-bye!
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
See ya! (Walks out.)
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.
You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
(shocked) What?!
Dude you said, "No!"
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
I don't believe this!
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.) Get out!
Get out!!
(on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Wh-what?! Why?!
(laughs) You're kidding right?
What?!
Uh, hang out?! How long?
No!
Yeah.
Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your big break.
(on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
(to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me now.
