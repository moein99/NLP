Oh, yeah, good idea.
Ooh, Ross, look! Look! (Points behind Ross.)
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
(to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!
You got to go on a ride along?!
I want to go on a ride along!
Yeah!!
(returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Oh-ho, yeah!
Yep!
(dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Yeah, okay.
Did I say you could smell it?!
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Are you thinking about Monica?
Yeah, what's that like?
Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Is everything okay?
(To Ross) You okay man?
Hi.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
Bye!
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Dude! How come you took off?
Is something wrong?
Okay.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! Iknewyou could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
I know it doesn't make much sense
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for Chandler) here.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
How good is that?
See?
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!
Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)
