Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
(to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
(entering, wearing a tux) Hey!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Why donÂ’t you like PBS, Pheebs?
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Well, may I ask for one example?
That's because all people are selfish.
Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
That he doesn't exist.
(To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
But I'm the host!
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
(on phone) Hey Mon!
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)
Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)
(in a bored voice) PBS telethon.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Come on man! You've been here all day!
(in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.
Hey Pheebs!
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
