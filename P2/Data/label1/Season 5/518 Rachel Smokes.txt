Okay, pick a card.
All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?
(holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)
(reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! (Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Luck!
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Done.
They're gonna do it together.
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
What?! Are you kidding?!
All right!
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)
(also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
(Happily) Yeah I did!
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
Who knows?
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
At least I care about his feelings!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesnt get it?
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
You just give him a spoon baby!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Yeah?! So's yours!
Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!
Oh yeah, no problem.
(goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
(angrily) Ross!
Hi!
Uh-oh.
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Oh, what did I say?
How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!
Hmm, noodle soup.
Okay.
Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful) Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)
Hey.
Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." (Nods his head in disgust.)
What you do mean?
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Eh, what are you gonna do?
