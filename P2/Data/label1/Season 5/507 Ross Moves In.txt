No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Why?
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Yeah.
Okay.
Ross?
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Hey, all right!
(To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?
Hey.
Nothing.
(smiles) Kinda.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Sorry.
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? (Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)
No, the quiet down thing!
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
YES!!
Um-hmm.
(entering) Hey!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Umm, yum!
Mine! (He grabs it.)
Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)
Okay!
Yeah!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Yeah.
Oh, it's perfect!
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Oh! Oh!
Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
(getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)
Hey!
You're kidding!
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Definitely!
All right!
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
