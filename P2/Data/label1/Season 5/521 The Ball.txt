Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Hey, what time is it?
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Hey!
No.
Yeah!
What the hell is that?!!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
It's not a cat!
It's not a cat!
Uhh, the ball thing.
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Okay!
(catches the ball) Uh-oh.
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Hi!
I don't know.
Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in (Looks to Ross.)
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
That's right baby.
Oh yeah, that's right!
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented this game!
Did you get your money back?
Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
