Hey!
What are you guys doing up?
(thinks) Dark red.
Aww, you guys are so cute!
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Cat.
I love you too.
(entering) Hey, you guys!
(To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and Im not him.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the bathroom.)
(To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.
Yeah, I didnt know you guys were going to be here.
(backing away) What?! Why?!
Nothing!
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)
Well, it involved Monica.
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
It-it doesnt?
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
(looks at her) Not really.
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Friends first? That's interesting.
No, never done that either.
(in a sexy voice) How you doin'?
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you.
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great
is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
(entering) Hey!
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)
Uhh, well, she'sreally good in bed.
(To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her roommate!
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
(entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
(taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Oh my God!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
Nice!
