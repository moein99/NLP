Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
(waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.) (Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.) Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floorÂ…
Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica away and makes a disgusted face.)
This is your place?
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)
Ugh!!
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. (Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on his remote.)
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
What happened?
You kissed him?!
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's back!
No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. (He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)
Damnit!! Did you move?!
(Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!
(entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'? (Has a silly grin.)
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.) Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)
