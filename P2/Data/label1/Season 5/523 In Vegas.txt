Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
No! (She nods no to Chandler) Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Don't come out here!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that picture.)
Hi!
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him. Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.
Yeah, what-what's going on?
Dawson?!
Aww, there we go.
Ooh, so close.
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.)
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
(to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)
(betting all 100) Let's ride.
Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.)
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
My identical hand twin!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Dont you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
Pheebs!!
I found my identical hand twin!
(entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!
All right! Hey-hey!
Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her purse.)
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
(entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his hand.) See?
Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?
Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.)
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.) That's right, you take good care of those babies!
Excuse me?
It's me, Joey!
Do I know you?
(holds up his hand) Joey!
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Nothing?
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
(tries to leave) I have to get back to
(stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! (Singing, to the tune of This Land is Your Land) This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
That's okay. (Walks out.)
(following him) But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Hey!
Hi!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.) Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Ross, don't let her drink anymore! (Exits)
(sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.)
Are you gonna play?
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway (Shakes his hands.)
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
(throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho! (The dealer stares at him and he stops.)
(To Joey) 14.
Hit me! (He does so.)
Stop it!
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Please stop it!
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
(To Joey) If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Please, please take him too. (Motions to Joey.)
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by the guard) I'm your hand twin!!
