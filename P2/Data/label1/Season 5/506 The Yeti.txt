(entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
(from the bedroom) I can hear that!
I can still hear you!
Hey!
Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
(after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
I'll take it!
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right, what do you think?
What's the matter Ross?
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.) Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
We all hate Emily!
Yeah!
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone
(thinks) I'm not sure.
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor
It's almost as if he knew.
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back inside.)
What happened? What happened?
