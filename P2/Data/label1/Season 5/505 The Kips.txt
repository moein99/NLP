Monica? What time is it?
But it's dark out.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the bathroom.)
Hey!
Doesnt seem like it's going to work, I mean
Hi!
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
(holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Hey, you're back!
How was your conference?
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Hey, you're back too!
Hey, how was your chef thing?
(sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
You want my advice?
You're not gonna like it.
You got married to fast.
I told ya.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Hi, Rach.
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. (Points over his shoulder.)
Hey, you're not Kip!
Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?
Oh, that poor bastard.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
(entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
(shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
How?! When?!
IN LONDON!!!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but
Aww, I don't want to see that!
I guess I'm done.
I think I'm gonna take-off.
