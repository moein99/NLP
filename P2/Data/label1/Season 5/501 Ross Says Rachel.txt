Well, that went well. Yeah.
(To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Hey, whats up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, hes eating it with his hands.)
Well, I figured were in another country, so it doesnt count.
(approaching) Ross, hey, the bands ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so
You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
No you dont, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
My Giant? I love that movie!
Can I ask you something?
Felicity and I, were watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "Im never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think Im just wasting my life with this acting thing?
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yknow, you think Ill ever get there?
Thanks man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Hi!
All right, Im gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Why would you need to say hi to them, youve been feeding them for four days?
