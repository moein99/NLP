Yeah, they're mine.
I don't know uhh (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
(reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! (Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.
Didn't think so.
Hey, Pheebs!
What's wrong buddy?
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
So you uh, still wondering?
You're smart. I like that.
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
Hiya.
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points at Chandler, angrily.)
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just I just Kinda
Thank you!
What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading with Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
(thinking) I slept with Monica.
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Ahhoy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
That makes sense!
Uhh, Monica?
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)
