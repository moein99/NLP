(panicking) Dude! He's right there!
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.) Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
(quickly) I call Godfather!
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
(to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
So, are you ready to go?
Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)
I was thinking Chinese food.
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but
(shyly) She keeps punching me.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's hurting me.
(sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
No-no.
Yeah, big!
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Hey!
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Well look, Im breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Hey! Hiya!
Huh.
Uhh.
Nah.
What a bad idea!
She's right y'know.
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
That's not funny at all!
