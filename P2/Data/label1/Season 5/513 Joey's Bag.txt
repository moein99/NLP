Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Great! Thanks, Rach!
All right.
Are you all right?
Pheebs! Sorry!
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Really? A purse?
It looks like a women's purse.
See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Hey!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts eating.)
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.)
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.)
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)
(approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me. (Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap him in his face.)
What did you say to him?
(entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)
(reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new here. Maybe we shouldI'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a question.)
Well, first it's not a purse.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Yeah but I didnt read anything.
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the bag.) We got it! We got it!
(dejected) Hi.
Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the bag!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? (She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
