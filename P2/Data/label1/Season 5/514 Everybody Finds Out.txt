Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
(entering) Hey guys!
What? What?
You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
I can't take anyÂ…
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey shies away.)
Ugh.
Yeah?
Well I didn't tell them!
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
I'm listening.
So he likes to break stuff.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
No.
They know you know.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
(looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Ooh!
I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
It's not my first time.
Dude!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
