All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
What's the matter?!
All right, I'll take care of it.
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Chandler.
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Yeah.
Okay, great!
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Yeah!
So did that do anything for ya?
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Really? Who-who have you taught?
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Hey!
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep quiet as Phoebe enters.)
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Umm, okay.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's chords.)
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and
No.
Yes!
Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
You look like a freak.
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)
Yes! Yes, I did.
(thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)
Your other student, was you!
(looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)
(answering phone) Hello?
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Okay.
Nice!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Umm, do you see anyoh, Vaseline?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Ross? You okay?
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
(To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
I'm not listening to you!
Hey, Pheebs?
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You really think I'm ready?
Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note. However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)
(sitting back down) Was the chord at least right
Howdy partner!
Umm?
Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Do you know something?
I might know something.
What's the thing you know?
I can't tell you what I know.
Okay, fine.
You don't know!
(gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!
Yeah, I know!!!!
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)
Hey!
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
