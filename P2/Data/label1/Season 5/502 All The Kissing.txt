Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Okay.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
All right!
Mornin' Pheebs!
(interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uhÂ…
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
That was good beer.
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Later! (Exits.)
(To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.
Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)
Hey, Pheebs!
(Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!
(Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
(In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Yeah, all of us! All day!
Phoebe!
Mine!
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Which, is the new plan!
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
