I need something sweet.
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. (Note: Actually, I think every guy is thankful for thongs. That and spandex. J )
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
(muffled) Hello?
Phoebe?
Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)
I know! It's stuck!!!
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
It's Joey.
I can't! It-it's stuck!
Sorry! Sorry.
(pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
(turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are! (Starts dancing.) I scared you!
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
You're a dork.
