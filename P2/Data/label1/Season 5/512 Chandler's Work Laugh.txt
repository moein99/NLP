Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
(thinks) I don't know.
I don't know.
(thinks) I don't know.
Ohh, I know one thing!
They did it right there on the couch.
Hey Ross!
(eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?
(entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Really?
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
(snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Damnit Phoebe!!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
Judge rules, no violation.
Yeah!
What?!
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Yeah.
(entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Umm, hi.
