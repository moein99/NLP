Tongue?

[reading over her shoulder] Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... [rubs his fingers together]
You got all that from saline solution?
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
You could say that.
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
[to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Ohhh.
No!
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
[opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Oh, yeah, I do.
[quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little longer.
