Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Do we need a cake?
All right.
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
For Ross.

Cool.
Sorry, sorry.
What are these, like famous chickens?
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.

Charity.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Me too.
Fine.
Come on you guys, one more time.
Nooo.

You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
And we don't work hard?
And you feel like we hold you back.
Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?
