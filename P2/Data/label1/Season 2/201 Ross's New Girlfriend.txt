Um, this?
What up?!
(answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)
Needs some clothes altered?
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All right, when was 1990?
(to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen.
No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again.
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Can we see her?
How're you doing?
Ooh, that bad, huh?
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Frankie? What're you talking about?
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
