Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
You guys are messin' with me, right?
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Such as?
Check this out. Can I have this?
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
That's what it says.
What?
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Have you been here all night?
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Geez, look how fat she got.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
You want his yearbook?
Oh, yeah.
