Tell me what?
(sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Wow!
More importantly, was I any good?
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)
You're okay there?
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Hello Rachel.
Pirates again?
(sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
When we were?
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Can you hear that?
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
What?
Ah!
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Okay.
Bye bye.
(answering it) Yes?
Ooh. (leans against the desk)
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me.
Why not?
What?!
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
What are you talking about?
I can't belive it.
They do me?
I don't sound like that.
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Tyrannosaurus!
Work people? Nobody told me.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
You think I should?
Okay.
Okay.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
What?
Then, I don't get it.
They do?
I just wan't to...
But I just wa...
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
(doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Yeah, like in a cab...
Okay, hating this.
Here we go, here we go.
