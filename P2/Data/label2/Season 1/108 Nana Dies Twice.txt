Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Yes please.
He's a he?
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
You did?
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
WHAT IS IT?!
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Hey, gorgeous.
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
...Quality, right, great.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
You are a frightening, frightening man.
Oh, no-
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Hey.
Who are those people?
Hey, Lowell.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Really.
So- you can tell?
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
He is?
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.
