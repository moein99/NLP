I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
(bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Hey Rach!
Yes!
I have my reasons.
(on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
Hey, I've been honing!
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Can I use your phone?
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
She answered.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
If it helps, I could slide over.
Hello? Hello?
So how's Mindy?
Hell is filled with people like you.
...And boogie!
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
'S'why I'm dancing...
Ring dammit, ring!
What?!
(investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
What are you doing here?
...I'm, I'm okay.
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Okay.
...I dunno.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
