Any contact?
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianÂ—I don't think we need a third...
I think it's winning.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
...And what did you bring?
Janice?
(angrily) Hey, it's Janice.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
That's OK.
(disgusted) What? What can't you do?
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
I hope she throws up on you.
So...
Oh, what a crappy night!
Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Janice is gonna go away now.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Hi, Just Janice.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
(surprised) It is?
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Oh, no I don't.
I did, but...
Call me!
