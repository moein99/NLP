Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
You have to pick your moments.
I used to have that bumper sticker.
(to Rachel) You see what I mean.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
You'll get one.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
No, no, no.
(trapped) Uh, uh.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)
Where have you been?
Mazel tov!
(to Joey) You are really frightening me.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
(to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
I know, I still am one of these.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)
