Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
...And then he burst into flames.
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
I know I am.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
What are you guys doing out here?
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)
Oh my God.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
What?
(To Joey) You knew about this?
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
(To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
What was that?
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
That's very funny. We done now?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Really stupid.
Yeah. No. No...
Yeah, okay.
Nice save.
Hey.
Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Pretty good! I told her.
