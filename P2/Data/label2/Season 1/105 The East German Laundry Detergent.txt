We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Not a one.
Oh, right, right, shut up.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Yuh-huh.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearÂ—you want it to be dirty?
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
There you go.
Where are they? Where are they?
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Here we go.
Hey, Janice.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
What?
(covering) What... did you get me there?
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
That's great.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
That's it?
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
(to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Oh, I don't know, a million?
I'm fine.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
How do you do that?
We should always always break up together.
I'm free! I'm free!
