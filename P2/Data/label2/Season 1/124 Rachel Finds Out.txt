Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
(sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
(in a deep voice) Men are here.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Crazy bitch.
Hey!
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Forget about her.
Course there, they just call it food.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
(sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
(pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Oh, that's Ross's.
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
(rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
(quickly) H-He's in China!
What about the time difference?
Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
Hey, big...
(quietly) ...spender.
So how'd it go?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
I didn't know you had another level.
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
