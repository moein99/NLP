Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Hey, that was really good!
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
"Smoke away."
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Relax your hand!
Not so much!
Hey!
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
And this- is my reward!
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Hey, this is so unfair!
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
(deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
(sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
(leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
(returns) Yeah, alright.
