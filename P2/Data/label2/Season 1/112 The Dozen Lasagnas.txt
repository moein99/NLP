No-no-no-no, we're done.
And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
(sitting in living room, imitating Paolo) Mma, Mma, Mmaah
(to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
You think?
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
You think we're ready for something like that?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
I'm not moving out.
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Aw, don't do that
Hey Phoebe!
Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
More coffee over here, please!
Ooooohh!
So what are you gonna do?
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
That's patio furniture!
(gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
You pick one.
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
So, what do you think?
I know!
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
Wha-
What is it?
Hey!
We already knew that! (they hug)
Shut-out!! (They both start heading for their rooms.)
Yeah, get out!
(to Joey) One more game?
