Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
Hey.
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
...little playthings with yarn?
Could you want her more?
(sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
We're notÂ—we're not saying anything.
(to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...
And then he did.
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
(teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
(changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the cards.
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking): "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Call.
(to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?
Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)
Good luck.
(to Ross): I thought we had them!
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Go.
