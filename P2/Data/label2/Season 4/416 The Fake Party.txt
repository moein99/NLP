Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
What are you writing?
Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?
Hi guys!

What are you talking about?
Surprise!!
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)

What are the odds? What are the odds?
Okay.
Theres a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)
Hey.
Oh-ho, yeah!
