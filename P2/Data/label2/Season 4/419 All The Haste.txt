Ho! Ho! Ho!
Your pants!
Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesnt get it.) Santa Clauss pants.
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I dont belong here."
Yeah we do!
Are you serious?
Forget it! Okay, Im not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
(ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Forget it! Okay, Im not giving up the apartment.
Oh my God!
You do know that Wham broke up?
Where is Emily?
Man, didnt she like just get here?
Easy tiger.
So what are you going to do?
Are you serious?
Because youve only known her for six weeks! Okay, Ive got a carton of milk in my fridge Ive had a longer relationship with!
And I love the milk! But, Im not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
No thank you.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we cant leave in the small apartment after weve lived here! Didnt you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Screw the Knicks!
I didnt mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
And the Knicks rule all.
No. No. Were not gonna do that, yknow why? Because its not an even trade.
No!
Op, op, Im convinced!
All right, but you cant use that again for a whole year. Im in.
Okay!
Fine, lets do it.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Thats a low one!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Yeah baby!
Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) Thats courtside baby!
No they didnt!
Those were like the best seats ever.
Oh yeah, thats very nice. Plus, yknow they were free and theyre too small.
Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)
I KNOW!!!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
What the hell is going on?!
We are switching back, right now!
Well, youre gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, were switching it back! Theres nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
What?
I dont care, this is our apartment! And they stoleyou stole itour apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. Im getting back right now!
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You cant offer anything to us!
Totally worth it!
Good night.
Okay!
Oh, well, thats great!
