Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
You dont turn and slide, you throw it out! Im tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
All right, how about we, how bout we sell it.
(nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
(reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)
You want it?
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
All right look, Im changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
(looks at him) Nooo.
I cant believe you dont know what I do for a living!
(interrupting) Let it go!!
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.
Oh-no, hes right.
Im coming already!!
OH MY GOD!!!
Are you all right?!
(lets him out) What happened?!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
SoYou got in voluntarily?!
BEND OVER?!!!
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stop calling us.
Thats a good call. Right.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)
