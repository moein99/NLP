Six-hour trip to London. Thats a lot of Monica.
You got your passport?
There it is.
(entering, with Joey) All right! Lets do it!
Okay, cause thats not gonna get annoying.
Hey, yknow what? I was wrong.
Hey! (Trots over)
Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebes book as Rachel comes in from her room.)
(entering, with Phoebes book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
I am, Im ignoring you.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Okay. Listen-listen, were not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)
Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
No-no-no, yknow what? I really shouldnt have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnt cool. And if it makes you feel any better, Ive had a really lousy day.
Yeah?
Thats Thats was
How did you? How? How?
Im gonna go to the bathroom.
That was pretty intense huh?
(glares at him) I hope he did!
Joey, its been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Id like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear God.. (A cellular phone rings.)
(Continuing his toast.) And Im sure were all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. (No reaction from the people.) Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily. (He sits down.)
Out loud?
So how are you doing?
The guy was hammered, okay? Theres no way, you look like Rosss mother.
Because hes crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldnt want you?
(With the covers pulled up to his chin.) Morning, Ross.
Yeah you are!!
Well Ive-Ive never done that with you before.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You?(Looking over at her. She looks back.) We did you.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
I dont want to look.
Hey.
(Very defensive.) Im not seeing Monica.
What?
Oh my god!
No!! Okay!! Whats with the third degree?! Why dont you just shine a light in my eyes?! (Joey looks totally confused.)
Oh yea, your right. Its the second one.
What we did last night was....
Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)
Im coming over tonight though, right?
