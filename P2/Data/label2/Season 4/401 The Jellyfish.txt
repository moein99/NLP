(to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)
(jumping up) Oh, Ill go out and get you some.
Nope! Because Im not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, whos entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
I found a dried up seashores.
All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ive got canned goods.
Excellent hole, Joe.
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Weve got to do something!
Y'know what, hes right. Theres something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Me too!!
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, Im gonna break up with you!
Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Ill give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
NO!!!
(running over and joining Monica) Theyll never understand!
(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didnt think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monicas shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
And then Joey remembered something.
(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
(entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
I KNEW IT!!!!
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Okay. All right.
