Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesnt say cool anymore.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times.
You dont think Ive tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat.
No!
Oh no, youll have to come.
Why dont you just give him to somebody else?
Because thats the only part of you he can see when hes on the table!
Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
I wanna quit the gym.
(He turns to Ross and Ross makes a Be strong sound.) I wanna quit the gym.
(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.
Hey.
No, I almost did, couldnt leave Ross there without a spotter!
Were doomed. Okay, theyre gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Youre a genius!
Now, theres two reasons.
Thank you, Joey.
Hi.
No, wed just like to close them.
I wanna quit the bank!
To pay for the gym.
Hey.
Yeah Bunny-rabbit.
