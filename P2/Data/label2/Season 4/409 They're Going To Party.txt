Our eyes are closed and were about to cross the street. Very good.
(entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
No-no, I dont think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Kathys with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Im gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Woooo!!!
Oh man! I am so excitedI may vomit!
Look you dont understand, Gandolf is amazing. Yknow youre never know whats gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Oh yeah, its beautiful country up there.
Its not gonna be exactly like last time.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
(answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) Its Gandolf!!! (on phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then. (Hangs up)
Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Oh-no, yknow with Gandolf wed be out all night!
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
All right!!
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Well, those were seals, man.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.
Actually, me too.
Yeah.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Yknow what? Were not sad, were not sad, were just not 21 anymore. Yknow? Im 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Yeah!
