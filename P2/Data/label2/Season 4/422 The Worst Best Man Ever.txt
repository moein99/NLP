Hey.
(shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Oh, its awkward. Its awkward. Its awkward.
You can be the best man when I get married.
Oh no-no-no, youyeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Im not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Im not even Im not even
(entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Oh, Im Ross. Im Ross. Im too good for the Hut; Im too good for the Hut.
See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.) Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
He just said, "No strippers."
(banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. Ive decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Central Perk?
(banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.
(opening the door) What?
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! Youre the worst best man ever!
You slept with the stripper?
Hey!
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)
So you might say, its a magic ring.
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why dont you be my best man."
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
(to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
Way to be cool, man.
Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
He will, Joe.
Hey, come on, its not your fault.
No, you should.
Really?
Thanks man.
What a baby.
