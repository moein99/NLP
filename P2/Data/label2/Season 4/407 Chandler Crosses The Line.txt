(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean its bad enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows. Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, shes smooth! Smooth! (leaves)
(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
(shocked) What?
Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He cant believe he just sad that.)
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
All right! Bring it on, you
(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
Really, bitchin!
You mean like, music?
Yeah, I know what youre thinkin! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Come in!
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
No-no, hes not back yet, but hell be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.
What happened?
Why cant you tell her?
Joey! Joey!!
I thought your time ran out.
(to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. Hes running a little late, he says hes sorry.
So I guess its just uh, you and me then.
Yeah, I think it is!
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut
and then it got canceled.
Really?! You do that?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just dont make my tail too poofy.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Yknow who also has great hair is Joey!
What-what cha doin?
Kay.
(jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phones making sounds! (On phone) Hello!
Hey its Joey!
What?
Okay.
Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Oh.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! Its bad! This is bad!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Okay!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Heres what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means were unhappy forever. Sound good?
I have to; hes my best friend, and youre seeing him.
(interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Dont! Dont! See-see, youre getting me confused, Im starting to urn.
I-I think we have too.
Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?
Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
I sure did.
Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)
Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, I dont know.
You mean with Casey.
Or Casey.
Could be Casey.
Consider Casey.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
I kissed Kathy.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think hell understand this?
Oh, dont say that! Dont say that. Thats not true. Is it?
Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!!
God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Yeah, I know.
Hey!
Is that a real thing?
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Its-its about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Yeah.
What?
Oh uh, when?
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Yes, but I-I uh, dont have too.
Yeah?
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
See uh, thats-thats actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Its me. Im the other guy.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
How is that worse?!
Look, Im sorry! But theres nothing I can do, I think Im in love with her!
Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Probably because
