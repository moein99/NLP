Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when youre not working here?
Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe.)
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because Im exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Its not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
They dont have those.
Next time you snore, Im rolling ya over!
Hey, all right!
Oh, shes got you running errands, yknow, picking up wedding dresses (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!
Yknow, whipped! Wah-pah!
Thats what I did. Wah-pah!
All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! Youre going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Its 6:00.
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think thats, I think thats really cool.
What?
Yeah, well, I dont dance at weddings.
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind him and he stops.)
Hey!
Nothing.
What?!
(answering for him) Yes he did.
(waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Youre coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.) Im Chandler.
Hi.
You mind if I
So uh, what are you in for?
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
(entering) Hello! Little ones.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (Theyre stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Because Im cooler.
Well shes, shes the kinda girlJoey was unconscious.
Plus, you look cool.
