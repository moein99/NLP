Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
All right.
Wouldnt that be Frank the III?
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesnt think so.) Oh, come on! Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there. And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.
Hey!
And now youre giving me the message!
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Hi! Hi! Youre crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Raymond Chandler.
Okay, there are no famous Joeys. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, hell never be President. Theres never gonna be a President Joey.
Wow, youre, youre right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Okay.
No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
I have no name.
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Its Clint. Its Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)
Its Clint! Clint!
(entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
(pleased) Really?!
Okay. Thanks.
You wanna hug it out?
Yay!
Okay!
Bye, Pheebs!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
