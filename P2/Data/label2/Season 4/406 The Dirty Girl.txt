Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Well, I have a call in about that.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
(confused) Sure...
I don't know... um, Grease?
Rent?
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
A pen.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
For three years?
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Where?
I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Oh yeah? That's great!
[nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....
Hey! Happy birthday.
No he didn't. [Moving it back.]
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
[to Kathy] Goodnight.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Uh, the book?
What do you mean?
(tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)
