I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
So what job did you get Joe?
Great!! Thats great!
Youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Oh, yeah, sure, its not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Yes. Right where?
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
All right, we havent had sex yet. Okay, whats the big deal? Yknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
No, hes right, Im totally lying.
Well, Kathys last boyfriend was Joey.
No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Yeah?
All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.
Hi.
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
It was fine, yknow? But she didnt agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, Im all right with it."
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebodys killing her in there!"
Look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! Shes hot!
(shocked) There are seven?!
(Points to one) Thats one?
Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
That-thats bad?
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
