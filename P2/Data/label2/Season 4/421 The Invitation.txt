Yknow what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Phoebe is, making people.
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Why not?! I mean its just, its just climbing! Its just, its just steep!
Were going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Yeah baby!
(dejected) Yeah, well
Yeah, we could do that without yknow risking our lives at all!
(dejected) Oh, well
Yeeeeahhhh.
But Ill tell you something. One of these days were get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
Uh-oh.
She was not good. Not good.
Uh-oh.
(entering) Hello!
(sarcastic) Noo.
I didnt know that.
See, maybe thats the one we shouldve actually hidden.
This isnt one of those uh, yknow "If she doesnt come, we-we dont, we dont come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket
Oh, that's Ross's.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
Ohhh.
I KNEW IT!!!!
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) "Its almost as good as being there."
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
