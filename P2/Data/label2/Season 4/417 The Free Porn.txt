Treegers snaking the shower drain.
Hey!
Do we pay for this?
Maybe we shouldnt pay our phone billfree phone sex.
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Like finding money with naked people on it!
(stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!
We dont know what could make this go away.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look behind them)
We still have porn.
Or a job where you dont have to carry a table.
Its the theme from Good Will Humping.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
They dont really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, its over.
What?
Okay. (Pause) Good one.
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Whats the second part of your plan?
You put your fist through the wall?
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Are we in London?
Hey.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didnt ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Yknow what, we have to turn off the porn.
All right, ready?
Two.
Yeah, thats kinda a relief.
You wanna see if we still have it?
FREE PORN!!!
We have free porn here!!!
