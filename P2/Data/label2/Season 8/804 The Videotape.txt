Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I cant wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
Theyre terrific, and they live right here in the city.
Im sorry, were just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance
We reallydidnt get a chance to
Ross! Its got your wavy black lines!
Yknow who has a great video camera?
Lets call em.
Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)
What?
I dont know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
Yeah, were gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)
I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
(angrily) Was that another question?
Did you do it on our invitations?!
So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)
Thats the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Jenny! That is so Jenny!
