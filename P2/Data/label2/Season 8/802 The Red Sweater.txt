(to the front desk clerk) Hi! Were checking out of the bridal suite.
And Im the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey, come on dont be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
We got the honeymoon.
The wedding pictures?
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
Ill tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
What? What did you take a picture of?
Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
Oh.
Okay, well Im gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. Youre 32! (Exits)
Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Yeah but you dont need(Picks up something)What is this?
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said
So you dont have the cameras?!
So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak!
Great.
Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Yes! And thats why Im under the table. Celebrating.
Well this is great. Yknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, shes really depressed.
All my energy is going into not asking that question. I cant believe I screwed this up!
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Are you serious?
Marriage advice? Really?!
I dont know, Monica picked out the flowers.
She picked those out too.
That was her.
I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
(to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
Uhh Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!
Oh yeah. Ill take, Ill take your picture. (He takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)
Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
Why dont you go up on stage. Ill get a picture of you doing the speech.
Okay, you ready for the last picture?
Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.) Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)
Were back!
Its picture time.
(showing her the pictures) Heres a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And thats me. (Another one.) And thats me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
Eh?
Okay, so this isnt a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withwith this lady. Which by the look on your face Im sure youll remember. So we dont need(Rips the picture)Theres no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
Call it even?!
