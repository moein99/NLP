New haircut? (Monica nods No.) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods Yes.) Boots!
Oh my God!
Im gonna miss being able to afford food.
She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.)
Yeah well, too bad were gonna have to return them.
I have you.
Hey-hey.
You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
(returning to his seat) Hey!
(spinning around looking for him) I dont think you did a very thorough job!
(opening the door) Whats wrong?
Oh dont forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go into the apartment.)
Now sweetie, I know you dont like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has asupple leather lining.
Why not?
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
Okay.
Yknow, that party wasnt bad.
I dont see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
What honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. Lets go.
Whats going on?
What?
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause) Its oddly unsettling.
Hop on.
Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a little turned on.
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?
I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.
(pause) I dont have your boots.
Well, why dont you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Yknow what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)
