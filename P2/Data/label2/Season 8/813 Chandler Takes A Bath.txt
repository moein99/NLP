Are you, are you high?
Really? I dont like baths.
Honey, its not the bath I enjoy, its the wet, naked lady.
Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Honey, its 2:00 on a Wednesday and Im watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Oh my God, whats up?!
Oh no-no, no you dont, just come back.
Do you?
In London?
Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
If that.
Hey.
Sex on the balcony?
What is it?
Honey, I dont like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
Well, this does butch it up a bit.
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
(thinking) All right, this isnt so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because Ive got my boat.
Oh my God.
Im going to need a bigger boat.
Im in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think theres something wrong.
Im in the bathtub.
I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waters tepid. The salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. And the scents I used dont compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileOh!
The bath salts! Theyre starting to effervesce! Its different. (Pause) Its interesting.
Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
I had the exact same conversation.
I dont know! Joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
All right, lets break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Uh-huh.
He didnt say anything about that to me.
He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
But what did he mean by rules?
Because he was looking at her differently.
My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
You dont say anything.
Im not going to let you say anything.
Oh, God!
Do I smell essential oils?
Okay.
L-leaving my troubles behind?
Oh, its so hard to care when youre this relaxed.
(upset) Hey!
(To Monica) You told her?!
(sarcastically) Because its a relaxing and enjoyable time!
You like Rachel?!
(sarcastically) Yes were all in here and we would love for you to join us!
IllIll get you later!
Yeah. And what youre doing feels so good.
Youre not?
Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
