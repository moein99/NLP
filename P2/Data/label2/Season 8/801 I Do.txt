What?! What are you talking about?
Whos the father?
Why not?
As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
Yknow I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Before we go out there Ive got a present for ya.
No?
Ive been taking dancing lessons.
Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
I dont know, its these new shoes, theyre all slippery.
Not well.
Thank you.
Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)
What size shoes do you wear?
Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
(looking at Joeys feet) Those arent eleven and a half.
And the world will never know.
Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
But youre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Did it turn into sand?
(sliding up behind her) No. No, I wont. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnt want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Why?
