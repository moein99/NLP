You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
Whats funny about that?
Hey thats okay. So, where do you want to go?
The Hard Rock Caf�?
Again?!
You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.
Yeah, he thinks thats my name.
Oh its been going on way to long now. Yknow, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnt say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now its five years later, the donuts gone and Im still Toby.
No! That would be so awkward! LookBesides, we work in different departments. Hes on the sixth floor yknow? So he calls me Toby once in a while. Whats the big deal? It could be worse, its not like hes calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)
Shh! It is a family name!
Hey Bob.
If I see him, Ill ask.
Yeah!
Were on a semi-first name basis.
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes.
But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
I think its best sir.
Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
Sure, whats up?
Hey Bobby.
Uhh yeah. Yeah, its (Points down the hall) right, right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here.
Bob!
Well that puts me in a difficult position.
(entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you doing?!
