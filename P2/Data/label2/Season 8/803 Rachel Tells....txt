Hey! Babe! Arent you excited were going on our honeymoon?
(singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Id better go pack.
A Speedo? Uh, I dont have a Speedo. Im gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)
(entering) Hey, what was that all about?
(in a high pitched voice) What?! I didnt even know thatWhy didnt you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!
(in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
You already know.
Oh honey, leave them alone, theyre in love.
We are on our honeymoon.
25J and K, any chance those arent together?
No.
Just act like you belong.
Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)
Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)
Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)
Oh youve got to be kidding me.
Were you just ten seconds later!
(looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
What else is new?
