Hi!
Man, if only youd gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)
Yeah?
Okay.
Okay. Ive been thinking about it too, and I, I think were ready.
But you said you were ready too.
Yes, but havent you wanted a kid like forever?
Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.
Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it. Were good. Were really good.
But nothing has to happen until your ready.
What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!!
Im kidding. This is going to be fun.
Were trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler stops it.) Yknow Im not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
Period math?
Yeah.
Right here?
Wait a minute, its perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and were in a building thats full of beds!
Okay. (They start kissing.)
Okay. Uh, well dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds its not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)
Yes, 98.6. Youre gonna be fine.
Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right next door to hers?
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
If its not, then theres two of them. And that would mean its the end of the world!
Hi.
Weirdest thing. Did I hear(A nurse opens the privacy screen and Chandler sees Janice)Mother of God its true!
Jan-Janice!
Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
What?!
Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Its incredible, I mean one minute shes inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
So, do you know what youre gonna call her yet?
So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
You do?
Oh no, its gonna be named after some snack or baked good isnt it?
That was amazing.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
