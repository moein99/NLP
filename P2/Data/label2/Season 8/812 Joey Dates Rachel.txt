Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Pheebs you didnt have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang
Oh, okay.
I kinda like it here.
Well what did it do?
A vending machine?
Who cares? Its a stupid game.
I dont suck. Its sucks. You suck.
Why do you want to play this game so bad?
You are not going to believe what I did today!
I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they dont.
Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he cant straighten his fingers.)
Well Ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirty words.
Because its awesome.
Well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
It is when you put it together with that one.
Come on, he wont even know what they mean.
Have you talked to him lately?
No-no-no, if you unplug it, Ill have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at that! Look at that, its still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM (Read Only Memory, its a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!
With the claw?!
(smiles) Pull my finger(Looks at his hand)My hand is messed up.
I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both look at him.) Was it just me?!
One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)
All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
