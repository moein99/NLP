Her what?!!
You had a bachelorette party?!
I thought we werent gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Yknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
You went home with the waitress.
I cant believe you didnt tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
My God! You must be good in bed!
Shes okay with Rachel and the baby?
Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youre going down the same path, but youre really going down different ones.
What?
Honey! Thats crazy! I dont want you to get me a stripper
Look, I appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. Yknow? Im not a bachelor anymore.
All right fine! But Im only doing this for you!
And Joey.
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
What are you doing?
Okay. I cant believe tomorrows the big day.
Youre right, this is more fun.
Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)
Thats me.
Yeah, yeah right over there.
That was weird.
So shes a
I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Maam, are you also a stripper?
That is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone.
Oh actually, Id rather youYeah, go ahead. Were gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
Why would she do that?
This is the worst bachelor party ever!
(To Joey) In a minute? Whats gonna happen in a minute?!
Why me?!
Which is why you should do it.
You do it!
All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! (Joey smirks.) What?
I dont think weve actually done this before!
Well wewe still hang out.
Well yknow, things are different. ImIm married now.
Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on well make time to hang out with each other.
Her ass print is still on your grandmothers quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
Monica! Wait!
(puts on his crown) Carry on.
Could you not narrate?
