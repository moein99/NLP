Lets. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class.
I havent seen this dress.
You really want to take me?
So youre never actually going to pay me back?
I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.
(in a manly voice) Yeah well, Im gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)
This is so exciting! Its so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
What?
Its just so glamorous.
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
The whole thing! Can we go?
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Dont go! Im sorry. Im so sorry! (Sees another guy who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! (Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Im so sorry.
What?!
You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money
I dont know, five hundred dollars?
Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Do you want a calculator?
Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes
Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
Yes, money well spent!
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food
