Hey!
I dont see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
What?! No! No!
(incredulous) I dont know what thats like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
(interrupting him) We didnt play it!!
I didnt know you read tea leaves.
What does yours say Pheebs?
Well, Im sure you get another one at Ann Taylors.
Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
I know its tough now, but things will get better.
Im not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
Lets just say if I cant find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
In the James Taylor case.
Honey, Im gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Yknow alphabetically or by genre?
They were just giving those away at the store (off Monicas look) in exchange for money.
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
What problem did you tell him you had?
(singing) The sunll come outtomorrow! Betyour bottom dollar that tomorrow (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) therell be sun.
What?!
You can always sell your baby.
Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show theyre not in the baby buying business.
Oh Im sorry, youre kicking me out of my own living room?
Ill be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
