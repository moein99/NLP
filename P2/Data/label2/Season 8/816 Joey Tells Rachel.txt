Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) Shes growing inside you.
Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Oh hey!
No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist.
Why?
What?
Come on, dont be crazy. (To Rachel) You dont think theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)
A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
(mouths to Phoebe) What?
Whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still theres staring.) No?
What are you doing?!
I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Cheese you say? Thats some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Cheese, its smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Is it made of cheese?
(disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
What do we do?
Sure, why dont you set it up. Ill just be over here, browsing through the personals.
Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Im sorry, did you say cheese?
Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
No. But Im sure (mimics Don) tomatoes does.
You dont?
So youyou dont want to live with Don in a cheese house?
I love you.
Yknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesnt look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.
