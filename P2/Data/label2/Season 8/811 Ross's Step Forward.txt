Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry.
No.
Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnt it?
Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with that bitch.
Oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl.
Its a hand. Its a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
Oh no-no-no!
Hi honey Im home.
It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
Yknow what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like Its a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
Ooh, I dont know if were there yet.
