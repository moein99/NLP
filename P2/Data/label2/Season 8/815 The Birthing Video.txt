Happy Valentines!
(picking up a video from the table) Candy and Cookie. Candy and Cookie? Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some "porn")
I love you, St. Valentine.
Woah, woah, thats not pretty!
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)
I am trying!
(pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?
Its yellingbleedingdilating. Oh, the dilating
I thoughtmaybeyou got me porn for Valentines Day.
Well, Im not really in a sexy mood right now.
Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
How long it took to go back in the water?
You dont know. You didnt see it.
Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like hes going to throw up!)
See, honey, theres(puts his hand on her leg)
90 seconds.
You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
I can do that.
Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.
Oh, I know!
Poor Ross.
Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: dont watch it.
Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
(with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) Okay, here we go.
Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Wait, you guys, look!
No, the babys out! Look, look!
And look how happy the mom is now!
