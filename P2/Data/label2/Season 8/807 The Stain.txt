Hey.
Yknow uh, I didnt actually do this.
No, it wasnt you.
I got a maid. Yay!
Uh honey, I know you dont like to relinquish control
Look, shes really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
Yes, I distinctly remember cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
Whats the matter?
See? I told you.
(pause) What?
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
She mustve been planning this for years!
Honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
So, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we gosnooping around her crotch?
Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
(entering) Hi!
How come?
To see her pants?
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Oh dear God!
And yet you dont recognize that youre crazy.
Heres another planNo!
Why?
I fear a jury will see it the same way!
You see that?
All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if its not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
You need new clothes.
Im leaning. This is where I lean.
Brenda a bee!
Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
You do?
I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?
