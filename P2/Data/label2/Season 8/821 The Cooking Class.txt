Hey.
Im so sorry.
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
And people say you dont pay attention. No, this is a much better job. Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Thats what I do now.
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?
(entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!
Well, I got a job interview. Its kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and Id be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Me! I do that. So Seriously, do I look okay? Im little nervous.
Why not?
What about it?
(shocked) What?!
Are you serious?!
What is it that I do?
(To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?
I cant even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Oh good. Good, because Im sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
An hour.
Phoebe!
Chandler Bing.
Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) Ill let myself out.
I think youll find if I come to work here, I dont micro-manage. I dont shy away from delegating.
(suppressing a smile) What I do dois manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
Hardest thing Ive ever done in my life.
Oh! (Stands up.)
Really?
Okay.
also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
That I did. That I did.
(nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.
(trying not to laugh) I see.
(really try not to laugh) Good to know.
No dont I beg of you!
(relieved) Really?!
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Yknow Ive been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesnt understand) Duties. (Still doesnt.) Duties! (Still doesnt.) Poo. (Still doesnt.)
Oh my God this doesnt count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! Theres a crazy guy out in the hall!
Ill look forward to your call. (Walks away.)
