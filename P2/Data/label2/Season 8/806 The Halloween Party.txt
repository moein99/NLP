Youre an actor!
(entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
How is that me?
When have I ever done that?!
Wow! I dont have the worst costume anymore!
Oh! Hi!
Joeys gonna be thrilled! He was hoping youd come by as a slutty nurse.
Youd think that would embarrass me, but you see Im maxed out.
(To Ross) Marry her.
Howdy doody.
Oh relax man, relax. Youre looking a little flushed.
What question?
Theres no question.
(To Monica) You picked Ross?!
I cannot believe you didnt pick me.
Oh really?! You think youre stronger? Why dont you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)
(To Ross) Youre going down.
That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
And dignity.
Nope! I can do this all day.
God, Im exhausted.
No way! If anything youve gotta let me win! My wife thinks Im a wimp!
Youre Spudnik.
Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!
Listen, Ive got a secret for ya. I let him win.
No, I let him winRoss!
Would you tell her I let you win please?
I am strong! Ill show you! (He sits down at the table.)
Oh whats the matter? Are you scared?
Okay. 123Go! (Once again hes at a stalemate, but this time hes in pain.) (Pause) Im gonna kill myself!
