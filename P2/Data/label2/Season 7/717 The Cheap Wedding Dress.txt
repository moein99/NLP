So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that were trying to get to play at the wedding?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
Do you want me to call?
Staying out of the way.
Sure! Thats one of the great things about being engaged. Im not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
(To Ross) Smooth.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Huh.
Hey!
Uh Joe, when its one oclock in the morning and you dont come by? Thats okay!
Really? Right across the street?
Whend you meet her?
Excellent! Yknow Ross met somebody too!
Hi! Howd it go?
(sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Rosss situation?
So this is nice! I wish I didnt have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way, whats the name the girl youre dating?
Bye! (Exits.)
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
(returning) What are you guys talking about?
But I love swing music!
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And theres another reason too.
I dont want to say.
Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Hi, honey! Im home!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Yknow its funny I started it but, now its scary me. So could you come out here please?
Oh you got a wedding dress? Thats great!
Well then why cant I see it?
Okay I promise. Ill-Ill hate it. (She enters.) Wow! You-you lookhideous.
Yeah, thats like the most ugliest dress Ive ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh thats great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean its like yuck! Its terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Okay!
(without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
