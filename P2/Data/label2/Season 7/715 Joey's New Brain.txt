(To Ross) Monica said wedding.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
Too?
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)
Thats great!
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Dont do it.
I think its the dying cat parade.
(turning around and looking) Oh my God!
Yknow that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "Youre half Scottish right?"
Yes!!
Why is your family Ross?!
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Well, I feel like a snack!
Oh no thanks. I dont like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Thats not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Because we hate them.
We have heard you play.
No!
