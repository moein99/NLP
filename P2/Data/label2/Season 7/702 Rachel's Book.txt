Whats the matter honey?
(incredulous) Already?!
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
What in Gods name is that?!
Well, you couldnt get them anyway. Ian doesnt plan anymore and Derrick (Off of Rachel and Monicas looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldnt know.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Okay.
Centerpieces!
Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think theyre a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.
Uh-huh!
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
What a sweet story.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.
Honey, its gonna be okay.
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married.
Well, I have some.
Well, close to (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)
Well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Well, come on, Ive been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
No, I realize that honey, but Im not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Yes, I am!
Hey.
Ehh.
Look, I thought about it too, and Im sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Yeah, Im putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do.
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yknow? Well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Yeah.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, wed have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Sure you do.
You sure?
I love you so much.
Oh yeah, totally!
