Its your mommy. Its your mommy.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
And say nothing?
No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
No Im serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Oh no-no, I cant do that.
Okay.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, were on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebes secret?
Thats it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
(angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
What about him?
Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Dont show this to Monica! And dont tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey.
Oh its always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Hey.
Oh yeah?
Did you not understand the story?
Hey! Whats up?
Huh.
No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
Nancy Thompsons getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
I had too okay?! Were getting married! Married couples cant keep secrets from one another!
Du-ude!
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Ross came in forth and cried!
(To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wowwhoa!
Hey!!!
That was you!
(To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
Yknow when I said that because were getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah that was stupid. Lets not do that.
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldnt hang out withall the guys in my office.
