This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Yknow I think we should invite them.
Well this is just sad!
Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
(sees another rack) Well, whats the deal with these? These-these look nice.
You mean like for award shows?
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)
Not bad.
Whos that?
Pierce Brosnan?
Are you serious?
007?! This is James Bonds tux?!
Oh, I have to get married in James Bonds tux!
Oh, its not just that, I would be Englands most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
What?
You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!
SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
Please, dont take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Look, its my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
That was pretty 007.
Ross is Batman!
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Batman has a utility belt!
Batman has the Batmobile!
Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
Actually, I dont like martinis.
Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)
I would but mine doesnt fit. The pants are a little tight.
Well, does that mean that youre not going to wearing yours?
(standing up) Let me try it on!
(trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) Whats this?
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didnt wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
Well, youre welcome. And tell them were really glad theyre coming.
(yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
Whose is it?
Whose is it?
Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?
