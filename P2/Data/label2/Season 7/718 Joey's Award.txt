Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Kinda. Theyre really big.
What?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody its uh its mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and Im afraid even more sweating.
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Well yeah! But now that I know that youre having these thoughts, Im back to panic, anxiety, and uh Im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
(hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
