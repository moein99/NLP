Hey!
Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Thats me! Come on!
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
(transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
Ill be right with you.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. Its called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monicas eyes.) Say something.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
