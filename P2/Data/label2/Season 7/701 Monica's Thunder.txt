Hey.
Monica and I are engaged.
Thanks.
(To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door. Ill be in the closet.
Its okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.
To Monica!
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Okay.
Know what I mean?
Theres gonna be a wedding. Youre gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
(motioning with his hands) Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated. Yknow its like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)
Sure, you guys dont have this problem, youre made of wood. (Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!
You look great!
You okay over there?
Oh, dont worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
(putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Joe?
Uhh, youve had a lot of sex right?
Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted too, but I couldnt. There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
Its happened to you?
Well, whatd you do?
(angrily) I dont think thats what they were talking about Joe!!
What?!
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Yes!
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can!
Okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.
Its Paris, who knows were here!
Pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I dont care!
What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
(entering) Ahh, third base.
(To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
How is that ever going to happen?!
(To Ross) I dont care, she slept with me.
Thanks.
(interrupting her just in time) Hey! Heres a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
