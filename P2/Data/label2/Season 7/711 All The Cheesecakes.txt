Ohh. Mmm.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
(nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Ino! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Because it's too delicious.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (Reading the label) Mommas Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible, Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
So
Oh, whats at 8:00?
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then sushes him.)
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
I cant seem to say goodbye.
Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
(closing the box) Yknow what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Well, thank you for lunch.
So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?
Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Well, we dont want that.
But we should take it.
Why?
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)
Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.
What are you doing tonight?
Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Thats what Monica said.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Yknow what? I dont trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and Im takin it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)
Oh yes!
Oh yes!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Well thats not fair, youve already had some!
What do we use to split it?
(examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh Theres more crust on this side. Yknow? So, maybe if I measured
All right, Ill pick that one. (Points.)
(gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and dont come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)
Stick to your side!
