Do you realize you get louder each week?
I figured Id buy those. Pat, Id like to buy a vow. (Laughs)
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Do you happen to know what Im going to say?
(watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! Whats wrong with me? Ooh, dont open that door.
(writing) Monica, there are no words (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Im so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You shouldve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Yeah, Im not sure I can do that.
(seeing her) Okay.
All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
(shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) Thats one?
Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
(writing) Monica
(writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
You'll get one.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
No, no, no.
(trapped) Uh, uh.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
Nice try.
Look, Monica
This is not going to work.
You are so great! I love you!
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
No I didn't!
No I didn't!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im saying?
Oh my God.
Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Hey Joe!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)Diet Coke.
It happened in London.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Phoebe knows about us!
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Oh, you're-you're going?
(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Not if I kiss you first.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Who are those people?
Whats going on?
So we both finished our vows.
Dont worry honey, well make yours funnier.
Okay, what do you guys think?
You really like it?
I stole Monicas and changed the name.
