Come on! Why are we here?!
The hot chicks?
Wow thats actually pretty cool.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
You didnt bring me here to do that, did you?
OHMYGAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didnt tell her we were getting married, did you?
Did she freak out?
Right.
(laughs) You said no right?
You said no right?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checks in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I cant wait to read your book Ross!!
What do you think shes just gonna sit there quietly? You dont think shes gonna want to make a toast? You dont think shes gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Yknow what? Its gonna be okay. Yknow what? Shes probably not gonna even want to come.
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Yes!!
Yes!!!
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, its going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Were not even sure why were having it.
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Arent you just a tinsy bit curious?
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Is that what youre thinking about right now?
Janice, Im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight.
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Say again?
Feelings, such strong feelings.
I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
