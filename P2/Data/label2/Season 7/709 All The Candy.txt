Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)
Okay. Okay.
That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Im sorry, who?
But we dont know the neighbors.
Wouldnt it be easier if we just moved?
Eh, somebodys in a good mood!
Well, either that or uh(Motions towards Joeys door.)
(about to cry) Am not!
Dont worry, Im brave! I am brave! II am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?
(laughs) 4:00 A.M.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
Mm! Night Gar! (Monica closes the door.)
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
(with his mouth full) What happened? Im just eating candy.
Absolutely! Yknow, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
What is the matter with you?
Maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Yeah, thats her.
Yknow what would work?
Stop making candy!
You mean they like you.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
(asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?
Joey!
What are you doing?
Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and Ill bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
All right, yknow what? Forget it, all of you forget it! Youve ruined it! Go home! Youve ruined it! Youve ruined it!
Youre welcome. (They kiss.)
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uhare you okay?
