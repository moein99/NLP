(looking up with her) Thats a plane!
(with a quivering voice) No, Im not!
Because its flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)
(whispering) Monica!
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Sorry, I justcant sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover Im like(Fake snores.)
What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) Im sorry, I thought maybe Id make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Hey, yknow what we can do? Yknow, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, yknow like we did when we were first going out. Itd be fun!
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
(Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Thats correct.
(startled) What? What? What?
Yeah! You?
(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope youre not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Do you know what just happened?
No. We were in the middle of sexand you fell asleep.
(turning the light back on) Monica?
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Okay.
Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesnt move as he gets out of bed and as hes heading for the door.) And I probably wont spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
Do you wanna?
