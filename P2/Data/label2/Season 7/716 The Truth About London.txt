You mean the spitter?
Easy for you to say; youll be wearing a veil.
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say, "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"
Yeah!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Joe
(To Monica) Yknow, we havent found anybody else.
Yeah you can do it.
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Our minister
Okay.
(To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
Yeah. O-okay.
See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
No, not us (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yknow, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Joe?
Isnt that what happened with you and the brides maid?
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
But then later that night
(answering the door) Hey!
Well I was I was exactly expecting company after(He looks at his watch.) 9:15.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the brides maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youre not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Well, look its been a really emotional time yknow, and youve had a lot to drink. And youve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
You kidding? Youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
But we dont do that.
How drunk are you?
(thinks) Thats the perfect amount!
What?
I know.
Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
Okay!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Yep!
Count of three?
Two!
Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)
Well I think its safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh!
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e (Notices that the TV is turned off.)
No! No! No!
Theyre in my bag over there. (Points.)
Uh, could you leave me one?
Yeah.
No I-I-Im fine.
What?
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
(To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Oh, its not important? Its not important?! If it wasnt for a brides maid youd be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!
I dont believe it. The most romantic night of my life and Im runner up.
(To Joey) Look there is no way youre doing this wedding now. Okay?
Okay, its just weird! Okay? I dont want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I needI dont know what I need. I need a walk.
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)
Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Thats what you should say.
When youre marrying us; thats what you should say.
Id love it if you would do it.
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
