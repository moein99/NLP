Hey.
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
What are you guys doing?
Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth, this shall be known as The Face.)
I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
Yeah, Im not in that.
All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going. (Does The Face while saying that last part.)
How about those three pointers?
And those guys were this (Doing the standard "This Close" gesture) close to lettin us play this time too.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean yknow you cant date him right?
Dude that is so sad.
Could I play?
Okay. (Does The Face.)
No, I am.
I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)
Okay. (Youll have to see it, I cant describe the face he makes, but it isnt good.)
Aww! (Smiles.)
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
I cant help it!
Borrow money from me?
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Hey!
(Pause) Im right here!
Im still right here!
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their attention.)
There I am!
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
I dont know, but dont worry, dont worry, because I know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look down, look down (He falls asleep.)
(awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
Ahhh.
Oh yeah, that looks good.
Okay.
Im marrying her.
