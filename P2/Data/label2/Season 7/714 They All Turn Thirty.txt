(To Monica) Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
No Rach, its not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasnt that much fun.
Ross, a sports car? Wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
(To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monicas gonna be here any minute!
(frustrated) Okay, for the last time. Its not named for each individual man.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I cant believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I cant believe that you would have a tux thats thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Gellers shoulder.)
Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)
(getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out whats going on.
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Yes!
Yes!!
Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.
Yeah, Ill take care of it.
(laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Okay.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller whos sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller whos standing next to him.)
(correcting her) Phil.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her) youre doing great. Youre doing great. Youre doing fine.
Monicas a little drunk.
(To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesnt want her parents to know shes drunk.
Monicas wasted.
(To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read the card! Read the card!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
No, because youre not a grandmother!
(to a waiter) Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.
(To Monica) How are you feeling?
(To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone.
Pheebs!!
I think its necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)
What?
Okay, here we go.
Hey! Howd it go?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
