Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
The young hot ball and chain.
Whats up?
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. Im buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
But youre still my friend?
During this timeare you, are you still my best man?
Do I still call you Ross?
(smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
So are wefriends again?
Okay. (Pause) You wont believe what Monicas older brother just said to me!
(entering from the bedroom) Okay. Heres a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Yes, include more people in this.
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Well you dont have to sound so surprised.
What?
Honestly? Me too.
Yeah. Yknow I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and Ill go allChandler. But nothing has.
Okay. Ill be right there.
Were the Bings.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)
Hi.
Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (Shes wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)
Hidad.
Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldve hid at the gym!
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that Im related to Monica. How is she?
No! No! No! I cant do that!
Because if I go home, were gonna become the Bings! I cant be the Bings!
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
No.
Its not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybodys! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And Ive met me; I am not Paul Newman. I dont race cars! I dont make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
I want to. I love her so much, but Im afrIts too huge.
Well yeah, but then
Depends on what you mean by we.
No.
Yeah okay. Well, whats the next little bit?
Yeah. Youre right. Hey I-I can do that.
Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Okay.
Oh fresh air!
What?
Ross! (He starts to get up.)
(standing up) Thats right! Im not!
I know about Monica.
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
You dont know?
Monicas pregnant.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and thats when I uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.) Yeah, yknow what? I thought anything that can fit into this, cant be scary.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so shed know I was okay.
You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) Im so glad you here. (He kisses his mom.)
Are you Joey?
You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)
Okay.
(in Monicas ear) Hes Greek Orthodox.
(To Ross) No, thats okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way its okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if Im sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)
I do.
(To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
Our baby.
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Thenwho did?
