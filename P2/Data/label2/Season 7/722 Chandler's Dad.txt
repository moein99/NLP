Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.
I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not the close. I havent seen him in years.
Well he doesnt have to know! Its not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Trust me, you dont want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Whats this?
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money well save!! (Monica just looks at him.) Were not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Yknow we already went over this and I won!
Look forget it okay? I dont want to go. I dont want to see him. I dont wanna.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. Youre skinny. Youre wearing speedoesThat your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Does it matter?!
Yeah o-okay, but Im just doing this for you.
So I really never get to win anymore?
Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)
No! No! I dont want him to know were yet! Im not sure Im ready for that. And besides hes not gonna be too happy to see me either.
I dont know if Ive told you this, but hes kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Yeah, hes made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Yknow its all very Cats in the CradleI dont want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.
And theres daddy!
Believe me, Ive been saying that for years. Oh my God!
Thats Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Hes coming into the audience. Hes coming into the audience.
It cant happen like this. Okay? Ill meet you back at the hotel.
(resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
Oh, theyre a hoot.
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Wait! Wait! Wed really love it if you could be there.
I know it would make me happy, maam.
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
(To Monica) When I was growing up Iplayed the one on the far left.
