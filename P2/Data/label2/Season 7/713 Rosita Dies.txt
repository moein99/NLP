Couldnt I just say, "This is Ross?"
(knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
Joey! Joe! (Sees that hes not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beers still cold. Something terrible mustve happened here! (He decides its not that important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
Hey!
Yeah, Id love to but Ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore.
(excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Thats awesome! Thats great! What made you do it?!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joeys chair?
I thought I broke Joeys chair! Thats why I replaced it with mine!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Im gettin my chair back! (Heads for Joey and Rachels.)
Joey you broke my chair!!
I think I should get the chair!
Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!
Well, wheres the logic in that?!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
