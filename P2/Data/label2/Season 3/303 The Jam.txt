(going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Hey.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Because the kids need new shoes.
Do I look fat?
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
That's easy, baggage claim.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Thank you Rachel.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
Yeah.
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Okay, one question.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
That, that's what's stupid.
Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
You mean there's more than one of us.
And that's how you bought it?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Sure. What's up?
