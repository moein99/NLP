(to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.
(reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
Youre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, Ill be your boyfriend.
Why is that so funny?
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. I show up at your door, and Im like (in a fake voice) Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.
Hey!!
Hey!
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I cant have children!!
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Big bullies!!
Hey!
Bored and bored!
Yes!
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material?
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Yeah, well, lucky for you.
I dont know.
Oh, yeah, I dont know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Where ya going?
(to Joey) Noo!! I dont care! Im not, Im not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
Gnight.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You dont need that kindve hurt. Take it from a guy whos never had a long term relationship......
Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
There is not one hair on that head.
(in a fake voice) Hi there.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, youre gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Hi! Im Dorf! Youre date for the evening. (Monica walks away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, thats good stuff!!
