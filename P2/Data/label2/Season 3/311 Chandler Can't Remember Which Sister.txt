(entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
I just saw Janice.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kids pretzel at them.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Oh, y'know what, Im gonna be okay, you dont have to throw a party for me.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, its supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Hello-dillillio!!
(to Monica) Take off your shirt!
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
(to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Hi Joeys sisters!
Oh, Im taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
No-no-no-no, no, its a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why cant we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joeys sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.
Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing.
Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well, thats not the worst part.
I cant remember which sister.
Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
(to Monica) You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Veronica. Look, its got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Look, when Ive been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and Im sorry.
Why cant we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Its gotta be the first one.
Yep, Im in a tree.
Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually Ill be in Cuba.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
(shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Im here to see Mary-Angela.
Wheres Mary-Angela?
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Well, its, its yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
So um, Mary-Angela, whats your second favorite?
Would you just please....give me the receipt cause this is great. Its top notch.
So will I.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnt mean anything.
Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
(startled) Hey!
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and Im not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Ahhhh, youre not Mary-Angela.
This is so bad. If-if youre not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Oh, this is soo bad. (doesnt see Mary-Angela)
No Joey! No Joey! Dont Joey! Joey!
(pats him on the shoulder) Youre it! Now run and hide!
I wasnt sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joeys sisters gasp) Look, Im sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brothers not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, youre my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Okay, absolutely!
Youve got it. (he starts to look at his sisters, but he still doesnt know which one is Mary-Angela.)
What?! (Cookie punches him)
Dont worry.
