This is the New York Times.
We are. Hes meeting us here.
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesnt try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Y'know what maybe its gonna be okay, I mean its been a week.
No.
Yes, yes, its just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Yeah, hes really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
(jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, Im, Im smoking still.
Look, Im telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Yeahhh. Im tellin ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Oh thats great, with my luck, thats gonna be him.
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and its Rachel again.)
Hey, shut up!! Youre not my real Mom!!
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
(to Joey) Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
What?
Beam me up Jesus.
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Oh, come on, theres a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
(to Joey) My lighters in there! (points to the cab)
Damn! (stands up) The tailpipes not hot enough to light this!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Ladies, ladies, lets just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monicas bra.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Okay, now lets decide who has the nicest ass.
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)
Well its very unsettling.
Hey!!
Oh no, now its not gonna make any sense!
Oh, this is horrible, its just horrible.
No, I wasnt gonna ask you that, no.
Its horrible.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handles my middle name. Actually its the ah, middle part of my first name.
Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
