(entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? Im going down to the Xerox place.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Yeah! You wanna come?
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Uh-oh.
(to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.
Well ah, ........y'know.
All right, rock on. (Does the Hang 10 sign, then hides his face in shame.)
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
What time is it now?
Yeah all right, so well hang out.
Yes. Vividly.
Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
She was kidding.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Well it you dont know that, then I dont want to do this with you.
And thats the only colour that comes in.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Why? What happened to him?
