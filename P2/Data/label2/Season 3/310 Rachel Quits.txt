(reading the comics) Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
(thinks about it) Yeah?
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Look out kids, hes coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, its the only chance to see New York.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Because, Im too afraid.
Yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
(to Joey) Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)
I spelled out boobies.
So, how many have you sold so far?
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Me! On my computer.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Something else I might have said?
You-you-you dont wanna give into the fear.
Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
(to Rachel, whos entering) Hey! Howd the interview go?
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Its like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
(to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Im an alien. Im an alien.
