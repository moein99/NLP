Do you think that theres a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as youre driving into town theres-theres like a sign, and it says Youre in Sample. (He says it like urine sample.)
Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre are no rules.
Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah...
All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Well, I didnt do anything. I didnt want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between em.
(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
(to his co-workers) What is with him?
Well, thats not true, he-he smacked you once.
No sir.
(joining them) Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!
No, I ah, I didnt do them.
No, no I just ah, didnt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Doug!!
Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
No, no. It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Oh, and dont get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. Its just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all the other guys jealous.
Okay. (he starts to leave)
Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)
Thank you, sir.
No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
