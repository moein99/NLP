No, no, no, I dont, I dont really wanna play.
Thats not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Dont say that I dont have goals!
Yeah, all right, Ill play.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
And was the curse lifted?
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom wont let me cross the street.
And then Tineals.
What?
Wow! Just like in the pros.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks Rosss foot instead.)
Sorry. Im sorry. Y'know what, were just gonna throw it.
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
(coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between Rosss legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?
(from the shotgun) Hike!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
No, no, no, no, no!
(running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees Marhan) Hi, Im Chandler.
Mar-haaaan.
Yeah! Why dont you stick around. You can sit right there.
Well, that went well.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didnt I wouldnt have a shot?
Math!! Youre giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, well see who gets her.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Hey! Well, Ive been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you thats mean!
Before!!
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Okay, good.
(to Margha) Hi.
No-no-no-no, the games not over, were just switching teams.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Fine with me.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Yes!!
Well, you dont you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister Ill let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)
Wh-what?
Y'know what, it doesnt matter, cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Were not gonna lose to girls.
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so youre five feet short, so we win!
Guys! Guys! Come on! Its Thanksgiving, its not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
