Hey!
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
You're right, I know.
(joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
(sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.
