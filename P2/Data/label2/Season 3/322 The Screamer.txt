Ye-e-es!!
I had one.
Whos number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Bye!
Yeah, and I dont have any cologne.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
(entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
(seeing Joey) There he is!
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
I know.
So thats the girl you like.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you dont like the guy Rachels dating? Well, thats odd.
Could I borrow it?
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesnt work.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!
Ross, dont. Ross!
Ohh, thats a good one.
Why dont you use ours across the hall, cause shehasproblems.
Step away from the duck.
And yet, shes still not hanging up the phone.
