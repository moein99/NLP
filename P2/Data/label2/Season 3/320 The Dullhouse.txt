Wait a minute, wait. Youre telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didnt want you back?!
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Hey.
Oh, thats-thats okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)
Yes, I realise that.
Thats the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
Thanks, its ah, Gaelic, for Thy turkeys done. So ah, Im gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Hello.
(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin out the Chan-Chan man!
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. Ill do it.
(entering) Hey, my Fathers house does that!
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because Joannas such a big, dull dud!
(entering with Rachel) Im telling ya, Joannas got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Lets do it again sometime. Ill give you a call.
Thats what you say at the end of a date.
To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standing there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her and its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
(sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.
Look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say, In case you didnt notice, I dont like you!
Nooo!! Shes really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
All right! Fine! But its just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Its not a big deal. Its, just its right here, (points to his eye) and its all the time.
(He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.
The food there was, was great.
So take care.
Well, this was great. Ill give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)
Noo!
Look, Im sorry. Okay? Im weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
AhhhhIm not going to call you.
Im sorry. Im-Im-Im sorry that I said I was going to when Im not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isnt Rachels fault. Its me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And Im really sorry, its just that this is not, this isnt going to work out.
Yeah, o-okay.
Well this is great! Ill give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
