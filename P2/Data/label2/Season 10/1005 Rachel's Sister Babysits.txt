Thanks!
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
So excited about your letter!
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
That's where people make number two!!
(reading) I don’t... uh... understand.
On every word?
And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Word!
She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
(on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
(Still looks confused) They loved it.
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
That sounds like fun.
I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
