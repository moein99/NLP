What did I marry into?
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
(to Monica) I'm leaving you.
Who?
(looking around) Did I go to this school?
(looks over at her) Sure, nice.
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Awesome, the name really stands out.
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Hey!
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Way!
Fresh!
Mint!
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
I said it first, bro.
(angrily) Look, if you did...
Totally. I had sex in High school...
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Your hands are shaking.
(to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
Oh really?
Oh really!?
ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Really?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
Aren't you...?
(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?
Hi Monica.
O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
(smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
(sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
Not her!
Soo... you girls having fun?
Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
So where are you applying to?
I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Why?
You kissed her that night too?
Seriously, where did this happen?
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
What did I marry into?
