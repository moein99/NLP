That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
(to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Hey!
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
(pointing at himself) Little people?
What...? NO!
(he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
But you already gave all your money to charity!
I don’t think you can do that!
That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
What?
Of course it was!
RAT BASTARD!
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!
Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
(Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on the door again)
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
(nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!
What the hell are you doing?
Well, we're not.
We don't have a code word.
Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
(escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.
Ok!
What?
And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)
I can explain... Joey...
Oh, that's really ok.
Wrong number?
That's great!
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
