There's a hair in my coffee.
You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
I mean, you have a lovely home.
That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Hey, you must be Owen.
I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
You know how to use a compass?
You do? That's fantastic!
I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
What?
I got nothing.
Where are Bill and Colleen?
We have to leave!!
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
See? Intuitive!
Which technically now you should give back!
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
We have to get out of here, baby!
Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)
