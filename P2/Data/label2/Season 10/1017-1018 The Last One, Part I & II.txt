Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Oh my God!
Next time, can I say breathe?
Where are you going?
You can't leave me alone with her.
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
Okay.
So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
Is it really that bad?
I'm okay.
Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Wow!
(emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Well, that's spongy.
I know. He has your eyes.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
Okay.
How do you feel?
Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?
What do we do?
(panicking) Twins! Twins!!
Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
(smiles) Okay. Shhh...
Okay.
Okay!
(shocked) She? It's a girl?
(To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor) And that's enough!
Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Bye!
Have fun at church-camp!
I know! You ready to trade?
Okay.
We could trade later.
Hey.
Her name is Erica.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
I love you.
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Alright.
It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Okay, let's find these birds.
Well, that can't be good!
How?
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Joey, wait! The ball!
I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
No... It's all glued together.
I don't know. Maybe.
I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Did that movie ever get made?
And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
What's the matter?
I understand.
I don't know. Except that, for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
Well, I can't do it either.
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
That was... Impressive.
Sorry about the table, man.
You gonna buy a new one?
Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
Wow, this is weird.
Where's Ross?
(to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Oh, okay.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Sure. Where?
