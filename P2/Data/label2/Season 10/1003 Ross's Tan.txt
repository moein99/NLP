So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
How can you be so confident?
Really? Like you have a routine?
Really?
You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They look at each other, both embarassed)
...and beer!!
Hey!
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
(To Monica) Why...why?
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Hey Pheebs!
Who's Amanda?
Are you trying to do a British accent?
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Hello? Is someone on the line?
Hang on, sheâ€™s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.
(to Amanda) I get pedicures!
Hold on! There is something different.
Was that place... The Sun?
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
How was your date with Joey?
You didn't like that?
(without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles)
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Well, aren't you a treat.
That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
No, I just had to get a picture of this.
I see you later!
