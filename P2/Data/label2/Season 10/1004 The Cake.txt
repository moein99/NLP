Hey!
Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
I know, what are we gonna do?
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
I was not ready for this today!
To be fair this one does have nuts.
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)
Was that Emma? Is she up?
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
To the bathroom!
(Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
I'm begging you stop.
(Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Thats a bear.
Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
They left.
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
Ooh! That's my girl!
Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Me too...
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
I was kidding.
No, not yet.
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)
Let's do it, come on!
