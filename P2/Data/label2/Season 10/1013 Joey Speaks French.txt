So, where's Mike?
Hey.
Why are you wearing my apron?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
I'm so sorry...
Monica. Calm, self.
Why would you say that?
Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.
(enters the room wearing an "I love New York" t-shirt, a "Statue of Liberty" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!
Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
That's great.
So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
Hey! How was lunch?
(struggling) Oh, really?
O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
How do you know?
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
(nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!
