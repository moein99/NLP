Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. (phone rings)
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
What?
Bob here.
(on phone) What've you been up to?
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.
I'm back.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
But it's Ross.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
You know, I think I might just.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
All right.
Hi.
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
You can tell us.
We can talk about that.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Together.
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Fine.
Yeah?
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Bob here.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
So, uh, how was he?
Eh?
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
So, let's go.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
I can't believe the guys missed this.
Chandler.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Yes.
No.
