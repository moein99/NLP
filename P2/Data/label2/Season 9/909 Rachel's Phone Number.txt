Yep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?
Chandler Bing.
What's up Joe?
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
Courtside?� Oh my God.
That's so cool.� I'll let Monica know.
Joey just called.� He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
But hey, it's courtside.� The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . (Pause)� That's not the way to convince you.
I know.� You're right.� I want to see you too.� I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He's really looking forward to this.
Yeah, ah, ah . . .� I'll think of something.
Hey.
(Hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to Monica.)� Oh well, look at you.
Well, it looks great.� It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.� So . . .
See what I mean . . . (They kiss.)
(hushed) No, no, no, no, no.� Joey can't know that I'm here.
Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
Achhh.� It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.� (pause)� Except with you.
You know, it's funny.� I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.� (He raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and wiggles it.)� Hi ya.
Yah.
It's Joey.� (He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear too.)� Hey Joe.
What? Why?
Look I, I can't.� What's going on?
NO!
(softly) Can you . . . hear him . . . now?
No! Wait!
(writhes as if in agony) All right, look.� Just stay there.� I'm coming home.
Is that really necessary?
Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?� (Monica tips her head slightly as if asking "Did you hear yourself?")� I heard it.
All right.� I've got a plan.� I'll go down the fire escape.
Hear me out woman.� I'll go down the fire escape.� Then, I'll wait for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
I'm just going to wait for a little while.
It's huge.
(pause) Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
That's right.� You're husband's home.� So, now the sex can stop.
Joey said that you're in here with another man.
(To Monica) What is he doing?
All right.� Well, I'll check the guest room.
There's nobody here Joe.
(thinks, then turns to Monica) I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
I'm sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .� I didn't think you'd understand.
Yeah.� I feel so bad.� Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
I'm sorry. �That's the one thing I can't do.� I promised I'd be with Monica.
What?
Really?� You're gonna be okay?
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Okay, bye.
Hey, listen.� I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Game's tomorrow night Joe.
