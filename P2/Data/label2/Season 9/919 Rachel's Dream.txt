(To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!
So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Are you really that busy?
Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?"
(on the phone) "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" (pause) "Oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
I don't have travel insurance.
Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
New York.
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
That's insane!
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
(aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
Dude, you're shaking!
USA Today
And I also got... two more apples.
I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Dude, none of this is cool.
I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.
Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?
Yes, but the batteries...
Thank you, thank you very much!
No!
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
What?
Look, we have enough, just walk away.
There's a forest right outside.
Ok, go quick!
I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)
