He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Okay. Wow.
Sure.
That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
What?! Why does she think that?
Again, what?!
As we all are at some point during the day.
Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
Well, what did she say?
Does Ross know?
Well maybe you dont have to tell him anything.
If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Honey, weve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Im so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
Hello sir, you know Monica.
Look, we cant stay in here forever.
This is okay. Were all adults here; theres nothing to be ashamed of. Now, lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnt for fun.
(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would youWh-why (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we want.
Thats funny, this conversations how I got the bullet hole in my head.
Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
You still havent told Rachel you werent really proposing?
Joey, you have to tell her whats going on! And what did it look like?!
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Okay, look, just do it gently.
Hey.
