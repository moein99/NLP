(browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
I could fall asleep at a play.
(browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
Hey!
Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
(to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Where the hell is everybody?
(To himself) oh yes, God yes!!
I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
(to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?
Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
Did somebody sign your bra?
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).
