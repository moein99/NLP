Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
No! We're not borrowing money.
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Yes dear.
Hey Joe!
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
What? What do you mean you know?
Oh! Right.
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins writing a cheque)
Oh ok.
Listen...this is really nice. Do you... (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
What?
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
Yeah?
But honey you don't have to.
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
your ass?!?!?
They...do that?
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
(sedated) What?
It's over/Joe!
Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Aaaaand....... hernia.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)
