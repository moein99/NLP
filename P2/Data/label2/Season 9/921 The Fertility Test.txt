I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?
(to Joey) So, a professor, uh?
Oh, yeah?
Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
We really need to take those tests?
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
It's weird! In a doctor's office?
(embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
Yeah, I guess!
Oh, Come on!
Why are you here?
(to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??
What!?
I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)
(disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
(To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
(Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
(smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
(stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!! "
(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
Doctor Connelly just called.
Actually it's both of us.
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...
(seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
I'm sorry.
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
