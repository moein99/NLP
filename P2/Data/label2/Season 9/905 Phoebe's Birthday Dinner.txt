Good morning everyone, it�s nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?
(laughs) Well, don�t believe everything you hear, Ken. (both turning away to files) But yeah, that�s true. Alright, let�s get started, by take a look at last quarter�s figures. (The female next to Chandler starts smoking, towards her:) Ah, Claudia, aren�t you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses� ass?
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can�t remember why. (to everyone:) You�re not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
Alright, lo�look. I don�t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it�s fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke then? That�s almost rude, that I�m not.
(loud) Ken, please! No, I can�t, I can�t smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cigarette)
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
No! I just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Pheebs?
(getting in) Okay, something to cover the smell � Oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) Unscented!
No thanks, I�m good.
(shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I�m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
(still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack�a�a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) But it�s over, I made a decision, I�m not gonna smoke anymore.
But, those are for you.
I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
Will power? I�ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.
�kay, look: Can we just drop this? I�m not gonna smoke again.
You forbid me?
You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Then, I might as well � (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.
Fine. What!?
You serious? (follows)
Right, fine, I�ll do it, but no talking.
And no kissing your neck.
And lots of kissing your neck.
Look, I can�t do this. I can�t make luv to you while we�re fighting this way.
That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I�m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Mean it?
You are incredible. Unless, I�I�m not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)
Yeah, let�s celebrate life!
Uhh. You are welcome.
What?
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.
Leave it.
You tricked me to get me into bed?
I feel so used.
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
I suppose that Monica will have the � manipulative shrew.
You mean the lully story?
Oh yeah, that�s what she says. But maybe you�re not ovulating at all, maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
(to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
What�s the matter with me? Why I�m such a girl?
Mhum.
So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
