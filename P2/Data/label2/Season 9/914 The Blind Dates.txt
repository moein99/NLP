See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Wow.
Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
I don't do that.
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
Today is the sixth.
Yes, it's also 2003.
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Tough crib.
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
I - I don't think I can.
Because of Emma.
Sorry.
Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
Emma was doing it!
Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
I think we may have really done it this time.
You may wanna get some more of those too.
Where's Emma?
Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Okay. (Runs out.)
All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
No, no, no.
What? Why?
Your family name is Tribbiani.
