Hey!
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
No!
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said "No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
So are you gonna...talk to her?
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Why did I get married?!
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times, two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
Did she go out with him?
Ah! The high road...
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
I thought I had to make the jokes!
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
We still got it!
I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed
By drowning or...?!
Well...
Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Ok. First of all, this is green!
All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his �business� partners.
Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!
Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
And done!
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about there, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
No problem.
Yeah.
I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey.
Really? In front of all this people?
Oh my God!
Are those my wife�s nipples?
I gotta stop this.
You, touching yourself, out!
�Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him drink his wine.� So you just touch yourself for anything?
