Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Okay.
Sorry.
Hello!
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen, I made that up!
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said henceÂ…
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
So you're really okay with this?

So, rocks.
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Uh, Ross?
Yeah, we are so sorry.
Hi!
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
