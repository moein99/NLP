Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
What?
How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the point by now.)
You okay there man?
Wow umm, calm down.
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?
Thank you.
(entering) Hey!
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
What?
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
All right, bye-bye now!
Okay!
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Yeah.
Isn't that Ross's money?
I don't know.
Okay!
Too dry.
No!
No!
Yes.
I also said, "Yes!"
No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
(entering) Hey!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
(who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of pornÂ…
Really?
