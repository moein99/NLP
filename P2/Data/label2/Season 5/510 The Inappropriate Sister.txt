(Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.
(Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and Joey laugh silently.) Its been six months! Its not funny!
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!! (Joey hangs up.)
The British are coming?
Ohh.
Why?
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Okay, I'll stop.
You wanna play?
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
I'm intrigued.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidOp! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
(entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
(To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
I paid for those tickets!
Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
When did that happen to you?!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
All right. (Takes a copy.)
What is up?
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
(To Ross) I'm sorry too.
I am sorry, Ross.
This took you all day?!
