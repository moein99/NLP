(To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Okay.
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
(terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)
So, what are you gonna do?
Me?! Why me?
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
You mean scared.
Scared? Happy?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
(pause) Yeah, you're right about that.
Hi!
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
IÂ’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Hey Gar!
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)
What?
I'm not a dropper!
It's throwing and catching!
Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Not fun anymore?
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Oh that is over!
You guys wanna eat here?
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)
