Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
That's a pig.
Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
What?!
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
He thought you said gonad.
Love what you've done with the place.
Oh yeah!
Oh, the tears are real.
What are you doing?
You built a fort didn't ya?
(notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
I hate this thing!
(entering) Hello children!
Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
(gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Okay.
No-no-no-no!
Okay, so he's out of here.
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Not even on page 7?
What about that circled one?
Yes, it is.
There we go!
Let's go quicker.
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
We are bad people.
Yes that was a nice place!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
What are we gonna do?
About Ross!
(grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?
Ohhhhh!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Here we go! Here we go!
Hey!
You're kidding, no!
Yeah!
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
All right, buddy!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
