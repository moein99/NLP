It couldve been worse, he couldve shot her.
Hey.
Oh wow, I hope you dont take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, Im just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Seven times!
In a foreign, romantic country
Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
Well, I dont see that we have a choice. But, when were back home, we dont do it.
Yknow, I saw a wine cellar downstairs
Okay!
Forget it, thats off.
The mans got a point.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Oh, hello Rachel.
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Yeah, well be down in like five minutes.
Oh, yay
(To Monica) Hey, listen, why dont we go change in my room?
Wow, you look
Well, Ive got a girl in here.
Well, were-were hanging out in here!
Well, I suppose Id have to say you!! But, what if were watching a movie in here?
Well, Ross and Emily arent gonna use it.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didnt get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Okay!
Nope, not under here!
Well, you couldnt have looked everywhere or else you wouldve found her!
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)
Yeah, were gonna go.
Yeah, its a very large plane.
But, well stay here with you.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
We cant do that thats insane. I mean A he could wake up and B yknow, lets go for it.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Yknow, technically we still are over international waters.
Kay!
Uhh, no.
No.
Yes.
Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
Hey!
No we didnt!
Yes! Good thing we have that, Not in New York rule.
Right.
Oh. Yknow, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasnt because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me cause, youre really hot! Is that okay?
And Im cute too.
Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.
Bye.
(entering) Im still on London time, does that count?
Oh, good! (They start kissing.)
