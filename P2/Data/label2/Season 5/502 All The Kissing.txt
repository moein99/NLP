Ehh, you're just liquored up.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Hey Joe!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Hey, Pheebs!
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Oh that's not true.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Hey, Pheebs!
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little Y'know, it didn't have any It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Atlantic City!
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
No.
Okay. (They kiss again.)
