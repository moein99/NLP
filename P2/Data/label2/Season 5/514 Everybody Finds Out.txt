And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
(entering) Hello children!
Hey.
Really?
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
What's going on?
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Ow!
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Well it's not flexed right now!
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
That new mountain bike?
Your work makes me sad.
(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Are you serious?
(a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!
(entering) Joey!
Phoebe knows about us!
Oh man!
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
(initially worried, but gets over it) Really?
Yes.
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
How do you know?!
At this?!
Phoebe.
Come on in.
Sure.
Me? No. You?
So do I.
I'm gonna put on some music.
You look good.
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Oh, do you not want to?
(swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Oh, you're-you're going?
(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Not if I kiss you first.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
