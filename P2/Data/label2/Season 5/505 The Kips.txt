(quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)
Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
What's going on?
Uh, hey!
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Condoms?
And condoms are the way to do that?
(jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
(looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)
Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
What? Why?
Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
(turning to face her) Yeah.
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
(watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Damn Rollos!
Hey.
It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Monica. (Follows her out.)
Okay, fine, $300.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Yeah, me either.
Hi!
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
(entering) Hey!
Yes that was mine.
Yes that would have made more sense.
(entering) Hey!
I just came over to drop offÂ…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
So, I guess this is over.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
So, this isn't over?
Really? Okay. Great!
(stops her) We're in a relationship?
Okay.
Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)
Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
It happened in London.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Fun's over!
