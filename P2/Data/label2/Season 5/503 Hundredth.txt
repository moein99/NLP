That's right.
Oh no.
Okay.
Hey! You okay?
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
All right
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Really? Male nurses?
So they're going on dates? When?
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
All right.
(spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Oh.
Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)
(to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
All right. Very good.
Bye, momi-moo.
Yes!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
Okay, keep saying it!
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Really? Okay, so
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Right!
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
