(entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
So what happened?
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Come on, Rach.
I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)
(To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would youÂ… (He gestures and spills some of his coffee.)
Uh, yeah.
Why?
Ohh, so?
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
That was amazing!
That was amazing.
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)
Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
(gasps) So?
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)
Yeah?
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.
(entering) You guys ready fore the movies?
