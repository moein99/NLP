That's sweet, Joey.
Are you aware that you're still talking?
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
It's exactly like it sounds.
Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
I'm over here big guy.
(laughing) You did look like an idiot.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
(seeing her) Okay.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Emotional Knapsack?
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, dont take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Dude, don't do that too me!
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
Oh my God!
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Sorry!
Sorry.
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Okay.
Are you all right?
What?
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)
I can't believe this.
Yeah, well, sorry doesnt bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy all the time!
Nice try.
Look, Monica
This is not going to work.
You are so great! I love you!
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
No I didn't!
No I didn't!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
