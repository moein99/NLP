Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
It's your timer.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Good-bye muscles!!
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I justÂ—I didn't know what it was!

Done.
Hey.
Hey!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Oh my God!
And a date with a man!
(wincing) Yes, he is!
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
Hey, is Rachel here?
(coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
(falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
What?
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Absolutely!
Yeah! (They hug.)
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Oh my God!
Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
