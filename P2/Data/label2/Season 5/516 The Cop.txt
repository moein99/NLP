Hey!
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?
Okay.
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Hey!
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Hi, Joe.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I dont want to talk about it.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! (To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Well there you have it!
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
(entering) Hey!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so
(looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Okay.
Yeah.
(straining) Okay.
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
You think?!
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
(stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Nice!
(To Rachel) He has a gun!
