(deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'knowÂ…
(To Monica) Happy New Year!
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!
Hey!
Nice!
(reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Horn-swoggle.
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits down rubbing his temple.)
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
(notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe there's something in that area.
Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Oh my God!
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.
(entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)
