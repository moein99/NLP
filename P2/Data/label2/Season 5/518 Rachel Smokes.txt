Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)
Oh yes.
(pause) Yes.
Hi there!
That.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in agreement.)
Yeah, it is the best.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Hi!
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Y'know I rued the day oncedidn't get a whole lot else done.
(shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
I wish I had smoked for my career
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Awesome!
There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)
(to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Okay, great.
I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)
