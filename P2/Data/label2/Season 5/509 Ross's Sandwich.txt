Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Yeah!
(interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.
Well, yeah actually.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Help!
Hi, Pheebs!
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Well, what did the police say?
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
(reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
What is going on here?
Yeah.
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.
OhI don't know.
Hey.
(gasps) You're naked in this picture!
Ross?
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
And you're okay with that?
(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Joey's a sex addict.
Well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
