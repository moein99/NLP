(entering) Hey!
(To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!
(To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
(To Joey) Hey!
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Uh, what was that?
(entering) Hey!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Huh.
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Okay.
Wow!
Do we have to?
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Yes.
It's a great idea. (They kiss)
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.
(coughing) Art lover!
I said art lover.
I don't know, I'm very tired.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
(To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.
Can I give you a present now?
Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man! Dont tell me I did this!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
What-what Richard thing?
What Richard thing?
(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)
Oh my God.
Love your condoms my man.
Why?! What happened?!
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Thanks. (They hug.)
(pushing her away from another hug) Next time?
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Fine with me!
What are you talking
Really?
(interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Whoa!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)
Good luck!
I see.
(totally confused) What?
What's an identical hand twin?
Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
(totally confused) How?
Again I must go back to, how?
(Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
No!
That was Joey!
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Really?
Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)
(walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.
Really?!
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
(arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
8. 8!
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Noo!
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
Two fours.
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.
(sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Another hard 8.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
(spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
All right!
Here it is! Here it is!
It's a four.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
I don't think so.
(looks around) Here justtake this. (Hands her the sweater.)
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
Hello! One marriage please!
All right.
(singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
