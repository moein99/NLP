Hey man, what's up?
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Yeah.
Well, I like danger.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
It is starting to get dark out there.
(laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
Your tax dollars?
(leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
I can't smell your sandwich?
Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay.
Yeah.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
How do you figure that?
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
(deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
What's going on?
Uh, HELLO!!
(pouting) It was a car backfire!
Who jumps at loud noises!
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)
(returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. WhateverÂ…
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
I do not hate Ross!
What picture?
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
From a bullet!
Much sense?!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Really?!
Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
(with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
