Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joeys arm, Joey pats Chandlers shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same about him.)
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
(laughs) Isnt she cute? (On Monicas death stare) No!
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Oh thats so funny because we found someone too.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
A face ass?
No, our guy is just a floating head.
(horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Our guy has great hair.
Our guy smells incredible.
Hey.
Well, youdont look good Joe.
Thats still in there?!
Is this a service youre providing me?
Our new fridge? I dont live here anymore.
Uh-huh.
(not quite sure where Joeys going and is a little worried) Okay
Just tell her the truth! Tell her youre not ready.
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Joey, I saw you push him!
Uh-huh.
Hey!
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)
I can see it now, "Look dad, its the Sphinx!" (Does that party noise again.)
Yeah.
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Are you funny?
(To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cats name?
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Okay now it doesnt matter which one you choose, yknow? Its completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
(To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
You know the hotels?
Well, maybe you dont marry this one.
Good-good-good-good.
Hey!
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, yknow what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)
Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!
There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)
Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, youre too late okay? Because shes already with our guy.
It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)
(To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!
So what was it for anyway?
Yeah.
