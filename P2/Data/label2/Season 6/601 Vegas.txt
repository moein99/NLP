Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Hey!
Yes! Well that-yes.
We actually missed it.
What?!
Hi!
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Its a buffet man.
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Look, I just dont think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Yknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Yknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
What?!
(returning with Joey) Hi.
Hey!
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or
(not quite sure) You did.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this ones free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free.
I dont know. But I-I-I know I love you!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then theres a definite sign that we should get married.
Sounds great.
Ready!
(deadpan) Yes, yes eight.
That was so unlikely. Well, lets get married! I guess.
Thats right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Yeah. (They go pack.) Were doing the right thing, right?
Well you did pull his hair.
Im not getting into this again!
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
No!
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Yknow? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Me too!
No!
Jeez, relax! Its not like were mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)
(entering, slowly) Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im saying?
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Okay!!!!!
Okay.
Oh thanks.
The door hasnt been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I cant get in!
This is not a sign!
Its an old key!
I love you!
Are you hugging the door right now.
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
The keys stuck in the lock.
(trying the handle) It still doesnt work.
Oh.
Nice job Joe! Youre quite the craftsmen.
