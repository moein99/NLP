Hi, my names Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
So, is Janine around?
Can I check out what she did to my room?
(The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is th its like a guy never lived in here. Look, youve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) Its spreading already.
(Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
(Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box, thats too small to put anything in?
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, youre going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Defend yourself.
Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different situation.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Ohh, yeah.
Thats weird. I dont think my boss likes me either.
Yeah lets head off to work.
Hey.
You knowOh My God.
(Sarcastically) Really.
Yeah, what was wrong with your oldhuman teeth.
No, no no no. Youll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillarys bind, right?
Yeah. (Rachel walks in.)
What???
I am proud of all my friends today.
Hi, Im Chandler. Your live-in boy
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? Im going to go over to Joeys.
Yes, but I feel like Ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Nah, Nah, its okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
You know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
No thanks, Josephine.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
What is the matter with you ?!?
Youre arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Youre turning into a women.
Now Ive upset you? What did I say?
