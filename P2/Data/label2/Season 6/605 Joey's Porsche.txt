What?
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youre not married to anymore of us are ya?
You left a shoe here?!
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.
(not enthused) Yeah, all right.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Yeah, Im gonna pass. Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. Its times like these Im glad Smell-O-Vision hasnt been invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)
See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yknow Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)
Okay, Im a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Hey!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
What equity investments?
You dont even have a car!
And?
There you are.
(entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)
(entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe youre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Yknow? And it turns out I was wrong. And now its lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)
But you found the keys to his clothes?
That is true.
Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.
I think thats gum.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.
(entering) Hey!
Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
And protected them from a tornado?
Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
(pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
