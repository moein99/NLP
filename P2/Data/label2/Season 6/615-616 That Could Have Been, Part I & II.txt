Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Sure I would!
What, you guys really think that Im that shallow?
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? Id probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobs fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I dont have to wear a tie.
(entering, depressed) Hey.
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Was his question whats more boring than him?
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Ehh.
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Okay!
All right!
Hey.
Well its kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that hes not real.
Uh-oh, its my boss!
(reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
What?
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
I always thought having a heart attack was natures way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But youre not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but youre not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "Im with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "Im lost and I cant find food."
(approaching) Here you go Joe, heres the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)
Yeah?
Im sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Okay, anything for you sir?
Its not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Aww.
You wanna share it?
Whats this?
Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)
Oh you wouldnt uh, care. Its just a stupid comic book story.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he doesnt want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assistas his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that cant have lumps in them.
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
(To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
Listen Phoebe, hes right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Uh, what about yknow the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Im sorry youre here with me instead of Roger.
Well, I could make it seem like hes here. (Imitates him.) "Heres some little known facts about cous-cous. They didnt add the second cous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)
Okay.
What was tonight?
Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!
Four different women! Ive had sex way more times!
Nine.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Hey thats what I tell girls about me.
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
So was I.
We cant do this.
Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, yknow? Because youve been waiting a very long time and I wouldnt want to disappoint you.
I do like that.
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Stop it! Were doing this! Lets do it!
Okay! (They both get up.)
I have some moves.
Yeah, lets just forget it.
Okay!
Oh yeah.
(sexily) Yeah?
Oh my God!
Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)
Hey!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when (He fakes falling asleep.)
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
I bet he can.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine! (Does a kara-tay move.)
(sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Im the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)
Because you shouldnt be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they dont just happen. Yknow? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend.
I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor"
No, there were two.
Oh yeah.
