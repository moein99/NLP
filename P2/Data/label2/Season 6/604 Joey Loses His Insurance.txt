Hey!
Oh, whats the matter?
Yeah?
What?!
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go?
Oh hi!
Why dont you open with a joke?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not talking about Chuckles University?!
Thats the way I did it til I was 19.
Hey.
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
(opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed."
Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
All right.
Im sorry man, theres never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Hey!
Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?
Whats wrong with you?
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
Thats a hernia.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and lets just get that thingpushed back in.
Hey.
Oh Joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix!
Listen, Im really glad you got the part.
But are you sure you can do this?
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Im sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why dont you uh, lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
What are you doing?
Oh, all right.
