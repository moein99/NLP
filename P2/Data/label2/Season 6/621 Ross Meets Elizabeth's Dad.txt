Okay.
(To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)
Hey!!
Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Are you judging them by their covers? Because youre really not supposed to do that.
Hey!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not Elizabeths dad?!

But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isnt happy.) Youre roommate in college died didnt he?
Yes, we were just

No, the little girl creeps me out.
Why would the baby creep me out?
This is going in your book?
Hey!
Damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our faithful servants!
So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?
Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
Who?
Hmm.
Oh.
Oh-oh.

The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
Oh my good God.

(disgusted) What does it say?!
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
(To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (Hes wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Hi, how are ya?
(whispering in Joeys ear) The reason he just said.
Yeah, Ive been there my friend.
