Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
No, no, I keep trying, yknow? I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom." He may think Im sick.
Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?
All right.
No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, heres the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, Im gonna be moving out man.
Look, I-Im just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up Im moving right back in with you!
(entering) Hey!
(looking down) What gave me away?
Okay, so thats it, everybody knows! Its official, were moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Wow that was my scariest voice! Youre very brave.
Hey.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
Well, I-I still think youre very-very nice and very pretty
(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
Rach
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Well, Joeys my best friend.
You just said Of course youre my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)
Hey-hey!
I am now!
Okay, bye! (Exits.)
Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Not once did we do that.
Hey!
Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?
And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
