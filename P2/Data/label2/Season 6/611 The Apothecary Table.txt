Thats great!
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
So shes just waiting over there for ya?
(entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. (Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
Im not your garbage man. Im your mailman.
A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
You made pottery?
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore
so then the farmer says, "Thats not a cow and youre not milking it." (Everyone laughs.)
Look at us, were a couple of couples!
Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnt afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Oh thats too bad.
Thats funny, I saw no phlegm.
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
No, you shNo you said you made that up!!
Eh, theyre both good. I generally just go with, Monicas drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)
Okay.
Okay, one more time.
Perfect decibel.
Hey.
Oh nothing, were just talking. Yknow, blah-blah-blah.
Thats totally understandable.
Oh yeah!
And Im blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
(To Monica) Yknow I think you can take her.
Did you hear that?
Yeah, Im sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
You okay?
