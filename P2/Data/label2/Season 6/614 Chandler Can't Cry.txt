Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Im not macho.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Yknow? Im not a crying kind of guy.

Yeah?
Okay, well I wont uh, worry about this anymore then.
Aww, I love you so
What?!
So you didnt mean any of that?!
Hey.

(crying hysterically) I just dont see why those two cant work things out!
