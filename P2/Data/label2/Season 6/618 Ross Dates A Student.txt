Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, theres a big selling calendar, eh?
A hot girls at stake and all of the sudden hes Rain Man.
Oh, is that against the rules?
I see.
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Oh, I dont know man. I havent talked to her in like ten years.
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred
Oh okay, Ill-Ill try.
Yeah so, Tuesday?
(sarcastically) Thank you.
You just thought of that in there?
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Hows your room Rach?
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
God, its great to catch up! I cant believe how long its been!
(on phone) Oh thats great! Good for you.
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm (Joey mimes throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!
(on phone) Hi! Im back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, well do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)
Hi.
(To Joey) We didnt get to the audition. Im gonna take her to coffee and then well do it then.
Honey, it is not a date! I havent talked to her in ten years! You cant just call up somebody you havent talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, yknow? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
No, we only went out once.
Not once!
(laughs) Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business.
(giggles) My friends name is Joey.
Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
The nerve huh?
Refill?
(entering) Hey.
I couldnt do it.
Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight.
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no!
No-noReally?!
(breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later. (He runs off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)
(entering, sees Rachels throw) Ni-hi-ice!
(To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?
Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Really?
No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)
Hey!
So?!
Its Thursday! How was the audition?!
