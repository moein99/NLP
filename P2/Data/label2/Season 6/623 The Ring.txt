Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I cant figure this out! Its so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah! Paper cut!
No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.
Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Me too.
Hey.
Oh all right.
Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store weve been too and I cant find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) Its a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)
Yknow, Im so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Yeah, Im gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display counter.) Oh, this ones nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could youhold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
(choking up) Oh my God thats it, thats the ring! How much is it?
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, Ill go get it. You guard the ring.
No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)
No, did he hug you?!
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Yeah?
Im a little busy here Paul.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)
Okay! (Pushes him away.)
Do you have my credit card?
Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
Oh, I cant go.
Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.
What?
They put you in jail?
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
It was the ring!
I cant believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
No, its not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monicas face when I gave it to her, yknow? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing Im gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure its perfect.
I cant do that.
Okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
(to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Im gonna need to have that back. (The guy isnt sure.) But, in exchange Im willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.
No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You dont want to break her heart now do you?
Yeah, shes dying Of a cough apparently.
(interrupting her) Okay, thats enough honey!
Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and hes horrified.) Hey! Im marrying a dead woman!
Guys? (They ignore him.) Ive got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) Im gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)
Yep, pretty much.
(goes to hug him and stops short) HeyyyyWhat?
Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait til uh, it was official yknow? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because youre my best friends.
Im gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I know.
Check out the ring.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)
