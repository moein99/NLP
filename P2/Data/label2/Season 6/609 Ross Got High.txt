Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Oh! Thats great, they havent seen the place since I moved in!
(shocked at the news) Why cant I tell them that we live together?
Why havent you told them?!
Why havent you told them?! Wouldnt they be happy?!
Why wouldnt they be happy?
What? What? Why?!
Is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me?
Yknow, itll be okay. Itll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then well tell em.
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnt I?
Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! Youre parents like me, right?
Well Monica just told me that they dont.
(annoyed) Do you know why?
(angry) Well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess!
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
[mocks that last comment].
Hey.
Hey.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Whoa, snowing out there?
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yknow Ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
(worried) Hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Oh, yes. Well its very beautiful. Its cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I dont mean tight, I mean its not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]
(shocked) What?
You do? Why?
What?! Why did you do that?
How could it not matter?!
What about all that friends forever stuff?
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
The reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Yeah, Im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
(clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that Im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
(lying) Yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Thank you!
(In a parent-like tone) Ill talk to them!
