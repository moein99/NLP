Hey!
Ill give up my ticket.
And I think Ross is generous too.
Hey!
Ross.
(on machine) Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we are.
(on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens) Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!
(gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)
(angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He storms out.)
(on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.)
Im not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)
Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Okay.
Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready
Okay. (They hug.)
Totally.
Yeah, its beautiful.
I know.
