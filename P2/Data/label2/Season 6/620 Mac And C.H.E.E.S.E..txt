(To Joey) So uh, whats this thing youre auditioning for?
That is lucky.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Whoa, she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)
Oh, ok.
Oh, are we playing this?!
Hey! Howd the audition go?
So it did go well.
Oh thats great!
Oh my God!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Well, it is overdue.
(on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Oh come on guys, its not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it werent for (struggles to get this out) Monicas allergies. (The duck quacks.) Youre right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs, then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joeys not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)
(looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)
As crazy as soccer?
You mean you didnt get it from this?
Well, maybe we can fix it yknow? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
I messed up. Okay? Im sorry, I really messed up.
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodys allowed one mistake, right?
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
How is that worse?!
Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Look, Im not saying that you should magically forgive me! But youre not perfect! Youve made some errors in judgment too!
(lets him out) What happened?!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
So--You got in voluntarily?!
BEND OVER?!!!
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
...And what did you bring?
Janice?
Janice?!
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Cupping.
I cant believe I did this! What an idiot!
Do you think hell ever forgive me?
Yknow what? I-I kinda have.
You didnt see how mad he was, yknow?
(coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!
Oh my God!
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joeys not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) Hes still got a chance for the part?! Oh, thats great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, thats great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what hes writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause) By dog not flowers.
Please tell me you got the message!
The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Rosss! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Sorry! I-I-I dont know what to say.
(angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Yknow, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Well thats good. Because you didnt! And Im incredibly happy for ya!!
Oh, we could do this all day.
You are gonna be a huge star! Im gonna hug ya!
All right!
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
