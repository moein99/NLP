(watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that hes scratching his back with it.) Listen, Im gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
First of the month.
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)
Thats our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why dont I justwhy dont I just cover you for a while?
Its not charity, Joe
Okay uh, heres the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)
Uh, yeah.
So, well do the rest of the bills later then?
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt take it.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wont hurt his pride.
Well that would help the pride thing.
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Hey!
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Yes, but for the last time.
Hes at a dinner party.
Oh, I wish Id know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, lets play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Oh yes!
Okay.
No! No! No! No(Joey looks at him)one can beat me.
See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Still broken?
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)
Okay, uh, how about, how aboutyknow what? We could play a new game. A new game, its fun.
Cups.
Ill teach ya! Come on, come on, its really easy and really, really fun.
Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens, what do you have?
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?
Youre kidding right?
Well thats a full cup! (Pays him again.)
You win.
It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Not 700 exactly?
Double it! (He does.)
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Hey, I didnt make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. Of course, any card wouldve won. Chandler pays him.)
Whats wrong?
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Oh man!!
All right, lets play one more hand! One more!
I cant take the big white dog! You love it!
No, but waitwhat if I bought it from you, yknow? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?
When did I try to give you money?
Im just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youre okay.
(entering) Hey.
I know. (He kisses her.)
No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
Sure!
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Exactly.
Its not a real game! I made it up!
At a fake game!!
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Hmm, lets see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)
