to test the code:
1- run .py file in src directory
2- enter input file name for example in_1.txt (just file name)
3- result will be stored in out directory

explanation:

at the beginning program splits the sentence to get written forms then it concatenates corresponding phonologicalForms by using CSV file.
 
next it finds all possible sentences which have same phonologicalForms recursively.
